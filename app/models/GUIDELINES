Test
- Unit Tests (rspec)
  - Makes sure that code works as it should
    + Write a test when something fails
    + Write tests for all new model/helper code
- Gquery tests (Blackbox)
  - Check if gqueries don't change dramatically    
- Graph tests (Cucumber features)
  - Smart guys write rules in plain text, define input_elements and expected output values
- Integration Tests (selenium)
  - Website works as expected
- Code Quality
  - Automated code metrics
  - Code annotations
  - Sebi makes metrics

Continuuos Integration (simple)
- Always run autospec
- Make an alias for commiting stuff
  -> push -> rake spec && gupdev
  - Makes sure that the tests run before each commit and do not commit if test fails.
  - But still possible to commit without that alias. 
- Make an alias for updating stuff
  - git pull -> ...
    - Show comments like # TODO
    - Show comments like # TODO @robbert


Continuuos Integration (advanced)
  - cruisecontrol
  - Runs when 
    - commiting to dev(?) / staging
    (- Wouter uploads new graphs)
  - Load newest version of from github
  - Load newest db version from staging
  - Runs Unit, Graph, Gquery tests
  (- Calculate code metrics)

Cucumber 'features'
Examples:

  When I move slider 53/electric heater to 5%
  Then I should get a heat network warning

  When I move slider 53/electric heater to 5%
  Then total_electricy increases to 100 PJ

  When I move slider 53/electric heater to 5%
   And I move slider 55/chp to 5%
  Then output_element 23 gets values (50,23,12,30)
   And output_element 24 gets values (50,23,12,30)
