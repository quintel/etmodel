##
# Wrapper for (user-) variables of a request that are accessible to all models.
#
# I created a new Setting class, which holds all the settings specific for a user session. Such as :backcasting_enabled and so on.
#
# == Current.setting
#
# Holds all the settings specific for a user session. Such as :backcasting_enabled and so on.
# Attributes in Setting are meant for front-end and similar things. And cannot influence the GQL.
#
#   Current.setting.backcasting_enabled
#   Current.setting.backcasting_enabled = false
#
# At any point if you want to reset settings:
#
#   Current.setting.reset!
#   # which does more less the same as:
#   Current.setting = Setting.default
#
# The setting object will be persisted in the session.
#
#
# == Implementation details
#
# Current is a Singleton. Because it is used often throughout the model (and
# because of legacy-reasons), Current is also the shortcut for Current.instance.
# This is implemented by generating class methods calling the singleton methods.
#
# I chose not to use the singleton module "include Singleton" because I want to
# actually be able to reset the Current by setting the @@instance to nil. Singleton
# module won't let you do this.
#
