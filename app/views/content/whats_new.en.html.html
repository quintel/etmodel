    <li><b>November</b>: new production technologies will be added for the production of transport fuels and feedstock for the chemical industry, such as Fischer-Tropsch and pyrolysis. In addition, the use of transport fuels and feedstock for the chemical industry will be expanded for existing and newly added carriers (such as biomethanol and bionaphtha).</li>

<p><strong>New start year 2023 for the Netherlands</strong>
Replacing 2019 as the start year, 2023 is now set as the default for new scenarios for the Netherlands and all its regions: municipalities, provinces and RES regions.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/assets/pages/whats_new/co2_emissions_2023_en.png" width="800" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>This start year update also includes improvements in data quality, among others:
*   Updated values for final demand and energy production across all sectors, based on recognized data sources as Eurostat, CBS, Klimaatmonitor and Emissieregistratie.
* Enhancements in data on heat demand in the built environment, such as insulation values and useful heat demand, by using more up-to-date and higher-quality sources.
* Significant improvements in hourly supply and profiles, aligning with recognized data sources as the Pan-European Climate Database (PECD).
* Overall improvements in data transparency and documentation, see the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> for the regional datasets and <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/data/nl/2023" target="_blank">ETDataset</a> for the national dataset.</p>
<div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #E7F3FF; color: #333; margin-bottom: 15px;">
  <b>Note:</b> the national dataset is 
   the  Existing scenarios created with a Dutch regional dataset had 2019 as start year. These scenarios have been automatically updated to the updated datasets with start year 2023. This update may have caused changes in scenario results.

  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * After the addition of naphtha in the August release, the energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the industry sector wrongly included non-energetic emissions for naphtha, leading to an overestimation of this sector’s <a href="/scenario/overview/introduction/total-co2-emissions" target="_blank">CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a>. The original emissions are now restored by excluding non-energetic naphtha.
  * For <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/steel" target="_blank">steel</a> producing European countries (excluding the Netherlands), the transformation input of cokes in blast furnaces was counted twice in the start year data. This issue has been fixed. The flows of the Eurostat energy balance, see the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a>, are now more accurately represented in the ETM.
  * In some charts, the hourly electricity demand of <a href="/scenario/demand/buildings/cooling" target="_blank">cooling</a> in buildings did not cover all cooling technologies. This has been fixed.

<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Several sliders in the <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/overview" target="_blank">Biomass</a> section have been moved to more intuitive locations in the model. Specifically:</li>
<li>The use of wood pellets in cyclone ovens for steel production can now be set in the <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/steel" target="_blank">Steel</a> section.</li>
<li>The sliders that set the oil mix per demand sector have been moved to their respective demand sectors: <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/oil-mix" target="_blank">Industry</a>, <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/oil-mix" target="_blank">Agriculture</a>, <a href="/scenario/demand/households/oil-mix" target="_blank">Households</a> and <a href="/scenario/demand/buildings/oil-mix" target="_blank">Buildings</a>. Note: for some regions it is not possible to set the oil mix for all demand sectors.</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * The costs and revenue of respectively <a href="/scenario/flexibility/electricity_import_export/electricity-interconnectors" target="_blank">imported and exported electricity</a> were calculated incorrectly. This has now been fixed, which causes the net costs of electricity exchange with neighbouring countries to change for existing scenarios.
  * The data export of <a href="/scenario/data/data_export/specifications-annual-costs" target="_blank">annual costs</a> was not working due to an issue. This has been fixed.
  * Due to an issue in the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">modifiable profiles</a>, uploading a custom profile for weather-related profiles (such as solar PV and wind) gave an error. This issue has been solved: the weather-related profiles can now be uploaded again without any errors.

<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Naphtha</em> is now explicitly modelled in the ETM. Previously, <em>naphtha</em> was included in the aggregated carrier <em>oil products</em> as a product from refineries. Changes include:</li>
<li>Naphtha can be produced by <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/refineries" target="_blank">refineries</a> or imported in case of shortages.</li>
<li>Assumptions can be made for the final demand of naphtha in the <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/chemicals" target="_blank">chemical industry</a> as an energetic fuel or as (non-energetic) feedstock.</li>
<li>Datasets are updated to include the production and final demand of naphtha in the start year. See the <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Dataset Manager</a> for data for a specific region.</li>
<li>Results in existing scenarios might change slightly as a consequence of splitting off naphtha from oil products.</li>
<li>Existing scenarios created for Germany and Denmark with start year 2015 are now updated to 2019. This may have affected outcomes for those scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * <a href="/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">Modifiable profiles</a> of type 'Capacity profile' (such as solar PV and wind profiles) are now downloaded in the same format as they should be uploaded. Previously, a normalised profile was obtained when downloaded, which required a conversion step to transform the profile to the required format in which it needed to be uploaded. This is not needed anymore. Read more about modifiable profiles in the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/curves#modifying-profiles" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
  * For a few Dutch provincial and RES datasets, a minor correction was made in the rounding values in the start year data. The fix might have resulted in very slight changes (if any) in households heat demand in existing scenarios.

<p><strong>New tables available to explore economic viability</strong></p>
<p>The ETM now includes three new economic viability tables that provide comprehensive cost-benefit analyses for electricity production, storage, and flexible demand technologies. The tables enable users to gain a first insight in the cost effectiveness of these assets. The tables can be found in the &ldquo;Cost&rdquo; section of the charts selection. See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/economic-viability" target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>New features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The new table <em>Power shortage</em> is now available, which provides detailed insights into the volume, peak capacity and duration of power shortages in a scenario. Find this table via the charts and tables overview or via the <em>Power shortage</em> dashboard item (read more about dashboard items <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/dashboard" target="_blank">here</a>).</li>
<li>Improvements have been made in the Households sector concerning the available sliders. This includes:</li>
<li>The <a href="/scenario/demand/households/appliances" target="_blank">efficiency improvement of appliances</a> can now be set using a single functional slider, instead of separate sliders per appliance. For existing scenarios where the old sliders were set, the average efficiency improvement is transferred to the new slider.</li>
<li>The sliders that set behaviour changes were outdated and are removed from the model.</li>
<li>Consult the technical changelog below for more details on changes in sliders (inputs).</li>
<li>It is now possible to upload different <a href="/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">custom profiles</a> for deep and shallow geothermal technologies. Before, it was only possible to upload one custom profile that was applied to both deep and shallow geothermal technologies.</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * There was a bug in the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves" target="_blank">custom profiles</a> for hydro power, solar thermal and geothermal heat, which caused uploaded profiles for these technologies to not be processed correctly and prevented the related full load hours from being set. This issue has now been resolved, wich means that the custom profiles and related full load hours are now processed and set correctly.
  * For various Dutch municipal datasets, the final demand of heat in Households in the start year was incorrect. This has been corrected.

<p>The first stable version of the ETM is released, marking a major milestone for the model. Traditionally, the ETM has been under continuous development to capture the latest energy system modelling features, bug fixes and updates to datasets. The downside of this was that scenario settings, outcomes and dataset values could change over time. With the the stable version release, users now have the choice to work on the traditional and default version, <code>#latest</code>, or on the new and stable version, <code>#2025-01</code>.</p>
<p>The overview below shows the differences between <code>#latest</code> and <code>#2025-01</code> and shows how to switch environments in the model.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/assets/pages/whats_new/stable-version-release.png" width="800" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>The default and stable version of the model are at this moment exactly the same, but as <code>#latest</code> will continue to be under development, it will over time diverge from <code>#2025-01</code>. The release of the stable version does not affect any of the scenarios created before the release. For more information about stable versions and how to move scenarios to the stable version, see the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/user_manual/model-versions/#move-scenarios-between-versions" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

<li>Update of the chart &ldquo;Final energy demand in other sector&rdquo; where the carriers are now split into energetic and non-energetic (feedstock) demand.</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * There was an issue in modelling losses related to the treatment of natural gas extraction. This led to a mismatch between calculations for the annual and hourly natural gas balance and to an overestimation of natural gas imports in certain scenarios. This issue is now fixed.
  * The charts in <a href="https://collections.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">Collections</a> that show the final demand ‘by carrier’ and ‘by sector by carrier’ were not aligned. This caused a discrepancy between these charts in the total final demand of Liquid biofuels and Oil and oil products. These charts have now been aligned to resolve this discrepancy.
  * Greenhouse gas emissions from the Other sector were missing from the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/data/data_visuals/greenhouse-gas-footprint" target="_blank">Greenhouse gas footprint</a> visual. These are now included in the visual under Industry, Energy & Other.
  * Under certain conditions, the forecasting algorithm for electricity storage caused invalid hourly electricity prices to emerge during curtailment. This issue is now fixed and the electricity price becomes 0 €/MWh in hours with curtailment.
  * The electricity used in demand side response (DSR) in the central ICT sector was not taken into account in all calculations for final demand. This issue is now fixed.
  * The output capacity of <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/large-scale-batteries" target="_blank">large-scale batteries</a> (including battery systems combined with <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/wind-turbines" target="_blank">onshore wind</a> and <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/solar-power" target="_blank">onshore solar PV</a>) and <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/flow-batteries" target="_blank">flow batteries</a> is set equal to the input capacity, in line with other storage technologies. As a result, the installed output capacity of these storage technologies might have slightly changed in existing scenarios.

  <summary>**Bug fixes**</summary>

  * The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">full load hours</a> slider for solar PV did not alway correctly adjust the full load hours and production of all solar PV technologies. This is now fixed so that solar PV production matches the full load hour settings.
  * Changes in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">full load hours</a> led to inconsistent energy flows in solar PV plants for H2 and offshore wind turbines for H2 between the electricity and hydrogen production component. This is solved to ensure that flows between these components are consistent.
  * An issue in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_net_load/curtailment-solar-pv" target="_blank">curtailment settings</a> for solar PV led to the wrong calculation of the peak production before curtailment. This issue is fixed, the correct peak production before curtailment is given. The production after curtailment remains unaffected.
  * Due to a bug in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/temperature-and-full-load-hours" target="_blank">weather year set</a> (only for Dutch regions), the weather year settings did not change the annual heat demand of households. This bug is fixed.
  * The slider for turning off appliances in the <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/scenario/demand/households/behaviour" target="_blank">Behaviour</a> section of Households also affected the energy demand in the Buildings sector. This is rectified, the slider now only affects energy demand for appliances in the Households sector.

<p>The countries Norway, Serbia and Switzerland, as well as Great Britain are now available in the ETM. Check out the new countries by selecting them in the region dropdown when starting a new scenario.</p>
<p>For a complete overview of all data that has been used to create the country datasets, have a look at the <strong><a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/">ETM Dataset Manager</a></strong>. The final energy demand of the countries is matched as much as possible to the country energy balances. As always, there is some room for future improvements, particularly regarding heat and electricity production data. However, we are very excited about this first step of making the new datasets available. Feel free to contact us with suggestions using the <strong><a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com/contact">contact form</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, improvements have been made of carrier application splits in households for all European country datasets in the ETM, based on the <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.2908/NRG_D_HHQ">Eurostat final energy consumption in households database</a></strong>. The assumed values in application splits can be found in the <strong><a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/">ETM Dataset Manager</a></strong> as well.
Later in November, this update will be followed by an update of the residential and non-residential building stock, based on numbers from the <strong><a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/eu-building-stock-observatory_en">EU Building Stock Observatory</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hydrogen and electricity can now both be used to model the demand of international transport.
In the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-transport">International transport</a></strong> section you can model the demand for international transport in your scenario.
The modes of transport you can choose from are navigation (by ship) &amp; aviation (by plane).
Now you can use hydrogen and electricity as a way to serve the demand for both these modes of transport.</p>

<p>It is now possible to explore the role of hybrid offshore wind in future energy systems. The hybrid offshore wind turbines can deliver generated power to the onshore HV network or to an offshore electrolyser. The offshore electrolyser can also receive power from the HV network for hydrogen production.</p>
<p>Explore the new possibilities by setting the installed capacity of the hybrid offshore wind turbines in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/wind-turbines">Renewable electricity</a></strong> section. Additionally, the relative capacities of the electrolyser and offshore cabling can be set in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_net_load/hybrid-offshore-wind-components">Flexibility</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>New charts and a table have also been added to provide insights into the installed capacities, peak load, and annual energy flows of the hybrid offshore wind components. The Sankey diagram below, for example, shows how much energy flows between the components on an annual basis. Explore the new user output yourself in the ETM&rsquo;s list of charts.</p>

<h3 id="addition-of-beccus">Addition of BECCUS<a class="headerlink" href="#addition-of-beccus" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The ETM now incorporates Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Utilisation Storage (BECCUS) plants. There are three key updates to explore.</p>
<p>First, biomass power plants have been added to the model. Users can now install capacity for either must-run or dispatchable biomass power plants and CHPs in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/biomass-plants">Biomass plants</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>Second, it is possible to capture CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions from these power plants, by determining which part of the installed capacity is fitted with a CCS unit. This can be set in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/emissions/ccus/capture-of-co2-in-energy-sector">Capture of CO2 in energy sector</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/assets/pages/whats_new/net_effect_CO2_en.png" width="600" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>Third, a price for captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> has been introduced in the model. This price can be set in the the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">CCUS</a></strong> section. The revenue that can be obtained from captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is taken into account when determining the marginal costs of power plants or CHPs that run on biogenc fuels and have a CCS unit. It allows these plants to run for lower marginal costs. The costs of all captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> is shown in the costs charts.</p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-improvements">Hydrogen improvements<a class="headerlink" href="#hydrogen-improvements" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The hydrogen section of the model has been improved!  Now, flexible production options have been added.
Steam methane reformers, ammonia reformers and autothermal reformers can be installed with dispatchable capacity in addition to the must-run variant of these hydrogen reformer techniques. Explore these changes in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production">Hydrogen production</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>Next to these flexible producers, the modelling of hydrogen storage has been refined. Now, users can use salt caverns and depleted gas fields as storage options in the model. In addition, users can set both the volume and capacity for these storage options. These features can be found in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production">Hydrogen storage</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>Together the dispatchable and storage production facilities make up for the flexible hydrogen production routes within the ETM.  Which production route should be used first, can be installed by the user via the new hydrogen production merit order. The merit order of production can be set in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/hydrogen/merit-order-of-dispatchable-hydrogen-production">Merit order of dispatchable hydrogen production</a></strong> section.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/assets/pages/whats_new/hydrogen_production_order_en.png" width="500" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>The flexible demand options, which are the two hydrogen storage options for now, can be installed via the new hydrogen demand merit order. The merit order of demand can be set in the <strong><a href="/Users/mathijsbijkerk/Github/etmodel/app/views/content/scenario/supply/hydrogen/merit-order-of-dispatchable-hydrogen-demand">Merit order of dispatchable hydrogen demand</a></strong> section.</p>

<h3 id="multi-user-support-and-scenario-version-history">Multi-user support and scenario version history<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-user-support-and-scenario-version-history" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It is now possible to collaborate with multiple users on a scenario. Through the My Scenarios overview, you can invite other users of the ETM to one of your scenarios as a <i>Viewer</i>, <i>Collaborator</i>, or <i>Owner</i>. You can also invite persons who don&rsquo;t use the ETM as of yet. Depending on the rights granted, the invitee can view your scenario, make edits and even invite other users to your scenario.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img src="/assets/pages/whats_new/multi_user_en.png" width="700" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>Also, there is now an overview available of the version history of scenarios. This shows old versions of a scenario along with the user who last modified it. You can open the old scenario versions in the ETM, add a description to old versions and restore old scenario versions.</p>

<p>The building stock is now disaggregated at a higher level of detail. Households are differentiated by combinations of housing type and  construction period, including new construction. For buildings (services) existing and new buildings are distinguished. Additionally, users can set a prioritization to distribute heating technologies across the housing stock. Also, users now have insight into heat deficits per housing category, they can adjust the installed capacities of heating technologies, and have the ability to set two different representations of the thermostat profile per combination of technology and building category. Development of heat demand can also be set per building category in kWh/m2.</p>

<p>Many regions deal with energy flows that merely pass through the region and are not consumed or produced by parts of the local energy system. Users can now gain more insight in these transit flows of energy carriers within their system. In order to model transit flows in your scenario, you can set the inflexible export volumes of several energy carriers. Setting an export flow also enforces an import flow for the system to be balanced.</p>
<p>New charts have been added which give an overview of the transit flows in the energy system. The new features can be found in the <strong><a href="/scenario/demand/export_energy/transit-flows">Demand</a></strong> section.</p>

<p>With the inclusion of Cyprus, Estonia and Malta, all countries of the EU are now included in the ETM! You can check out these countries by selecting one of them in the region dropdown when starting a new scenario.</p>
<p>The base year data for these countries origins mainly from the <strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/energy/data/energy-balances">Eurostat Energy Balances 2019</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/potencia_en">JRC Potencia tool</a></strong>. For a complete overview of all data that is used, have a look at <strong><a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/">ETM Dataset Manager</a></strong>. The final energy demand for these EU countries was matched as much as possible to the Eurostat Energy Balances.

<p>Capacity to shift the electricity demand can be installed for the metal, chemical, and other industry. In hours when the electricity price is too high, the sector will then be able to decrease its demand. The shortage that accumulates during those hours is caught up at a later time, when the electricity price is lower, thereby saving costs for industry.</p>

<p>Previously, the use of flexible electricity demand technologies could be determined by manually setting the order in which these technologies could use electricity. This has now been replaced by price-sensitive behaviour. This means that for power-to-gas, power-to-heat and electricity storage a willingness to pay has to be set. For export, the willingness to pay is given by the prices of the interconnectors.</p>
<p>The behaviour for all of these technologies can be set in the <em>Flexibility</em> section, for <strong><a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/behaviour-of-storage-technologies">Storage</a></strong>, <strong><a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/behaviour-of-conversion-technologies">Conversion</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/scenario/flexibility/electricity_import_export/electricity-interconnectors">Export</a></strong>. New charts that can help you set the behaviour can also be found there. For storage, in addition to the willingness to pay, a willingness to accept has to be set. Alternatively, instead of the price-sensitive behaviour, a forecasting algorithm can be used to determine storage behaviour.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/price_sensitive_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>If it is profitable, power plants will now supply these flexible demand technologies. For example, depending on the prices, a nuclear power plant could be used to produce hydrogen through power-to-gas. This also means that power plants will produce for export when it is profitable.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> for scenarios that have been made before this update and in which the flexibility merit order was manually set, the willingness to pay of each technology is updated to replicate this set merit order. Please note that the impact of this model update can still be significant for existing scenarios, because the prices of the interconnectors have not been adjusted for export and import.</p>

<p>A number of innovative technologies have been added to the ETM and can now be explored. These technologies are all aimed at improving the flexibility of the electricity system.</p>
<p>First, it is possible to install inland wind turbines or solar PV plants that have an integrated battery system. By changing the capacity of the battery and the grid connection you can change the profile that is supplied to the grid. In the Supply section you can install these <strong><a href="/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/wind-turbines">Wind turbines</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/solar-power">Solar plants</a></strong>.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/solar_with_battery_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>Second, a new type of electricity storage is available: flow batteries. The innovative aspect of these batteries is that their volume can be scaled independently, and for relatively low costs compared to other batteries. These batteries can be found in <em>Flexibility → Electricity storage</em> → <strong><a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/flow-batteries">Flow batteries</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Third, offshore solar PV plants have been added to the model. These plants float in the sea, which increases the potential installation area for solar power in a country. They can be found in <em>Supply → Renewable electricity</em> → <strong><a href="/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/solar-power">Solar power</a></strong>.</p>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/solar_pv_offshore_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<p>Finally, new heat pump systems are added. These heat pumps draw higher temperature heat from a special type of solar panels, PVT panels, making them more efficient than many other heat pumps. The panels simultaneously produce electricity. You can install these heat pumps with PVT panels in <em>Demand → Households</em> → <strong><a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water">Space heating &amp; hot water</a></strong>.</p>

<p>The Energy Transition Model allows you to design your own energy system for a region of your choice, by making changes to its current energy system. For the Netherlands, we have now updated the start year representing the current energy system from 2015 to 2019. This means that when you open a new scenario for the Netherlands, you will see a representation of the energy system as it was in 2019, including the level of greenhouse gas emissions, the electricity production by energy source, the share of renewable energy etc.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> for scenarios that have been made before this update, with 2015 as a start year, nothing has changed. You can still access and edit any old scenario you saved under <strong><a href="/scenarios">&ldquo;My Scenarios&rdquo;</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The basis of this dataset update is the open source energy balance from Eurostat, which is complemented by a number of other data sources, such as the CBS. All of the data sources we used to create the new dataset can be found in our documentation on <strong><a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/data/nl/2019">Github</a></strong>. In addition, we have improved the process of updating our datasets, thereby increasing the quality of the new Dutch dataset and any future dataset updates.</p>

<ul>
<li>Capture in industry. A distinction is now made between various sub sectors and production technologies and their respective capture potentials, costs and energy requirements.</li>
<li>Capture in the power sector</li>
<li>Capture for hydrogen production</li>

<p>Multiple energy models are used to explore different parts of the complex challenge of the energy transition. A collaboration between these models makes it possible to exploit the strengths of each individual model. In the context of the <a href="https://www.mondaine-suite.nl">Mondaine</a> project, the Energy System Description Language (<a href="https://energytransition.github.io/">ESDL</a>) has been developed to support the communication between the different models - it allows the models to &lsquo;speak&rsquo; the same language. ESDL can be used to describe information about spatial, technical, economical, social and temporal aspects of the energy transition, all in relation to each other. This makes it possible for a model to build further upon information from another model. The energy system defined in an ESDL file will be converted into slider settings - this makes it possible to explore the future energy system in the ETM and allows you to continue working on the scenario.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-electrical-interconnectors">Multiple electrical interconnectors<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-electrical-interconnectors" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Many countries import and export electricity with their neighbors through different interconnectors, and the ETM used to model this with a single electricity interconnector. However, in the real-world countries often have multiple interconnectors with different neighbours, each with their own capacity, price, and availability.</p>
<p>The ETM now models up to six independent interconnectors, each of which have configurable capacity, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and price. You may choose whether to export only excess electricity, or if dispatchable plants may also produce electricity destined for export. You can realistically model all electricity flows across the borders of your country, and see an overview of all these electricity flows in a new chart.</p>

<h2 id="heat-demand-curves-for-buildings-and-agriculture">Heat demand curves for buildings and agriculture<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-demand-curves-for-buildings-and-agriculture" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The hourly heat demand curves in the buildings and agriculture sector are now temperature dependent. This means that the shape of the demand curves will change depending on the selected weather year. Previously, the ETM used static demand profiles for the buildings sector and a flat profile for agriculture. Both sectors now use the same profile, based on data from large gas consumers, which is generated dynamically using weather data. As a result, this profile is now also available for the weather years 1987, 1997, and 2004. Heat demand in buildings and agriculture responds to outdoor temperature fluctuations, just like households heating demand.</p>

<p>The impact of a higher or lower average outdoor temperature has been revised. In addition to heating and cooling demand in households and buildings, changing outdoor temperature now also affects heating demand in the agriculture sector. Heating demand in all three sectors now is more sensitive to temperature changes; the impact of temperature on heat demand is based on research by the Dutch gas TSO. See our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/outdoor-temperature">documentation page</a> for more info. This improvement is relevant for both the temperature slider and the weather year selection.</p>

<h2 id="curtailment-of-solar-panels">Curtailment of solar panels<a class="headerlink" href="#curtailment-of-solar-panels" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Installing a large capacity of solar PV panels may cause high peak demands on the electricity network. It is therefore desirable to be able to curtail these peaks. In some cases it might be smart to connect solar parks to a certain percentage of its peak power. It is now possible to set the curtailment as a percentage of the peak power in the ETM.</p>

<p>It is now possible to convert electricity excesses from solar and wind production into heat for district heating. This can be done by means of a power-to-heat (P2H) electric boiler and a P2H heat pump that only produce heat when there is an excess of electricity. The produced heat can be used immediately or can be stored for later use. For example, it is now possible to use solar and wind electricity excesses to heat households during winter.</p>

<p>The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) is dependent on the ambient temperature and is depicted by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. In the ETM you can set the COP threshold above which the HHP switches from gas to electricity. You can choose a setting that is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can also choose a setting that produces less impact on the electricity network. Two charts have been added to assist the user in making this choice: a chart showing the cost-optimal threshold COP based on the consumer gas/electricity price and a chart showing gas and electricity demand per hour.</p>

<h2 id="improved-heating-demand-curves-for-households">Improved heating demand curves for households<a class="headerlink" href="#improved-heating-demand-curves-for-households" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The improved hourly heating demand curves used in the ETM better account for the concurrency of heating demand. The new curves are based on the average demand of 300 houses. Previously, demand curves were based on individual households which led to an overestimation of demand peaks.</p>
<p>Note: Because the heat demand peaks for households are lower, the results of your scenario might change. For example, when many houses are connected to district heating fewer back-up boilers may be required. If many houses have a heat pump installed, the peak load on the electricity grid will be reduced.

<p>The modeling of district heating has been improved and expanded!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heating networks in households, buildings, and agriculture have been merged into one network (&ldquo;<strong>residential district heating</strong>&rdquo;). It is no longer possible to exchange excess heat between industrial (steam) networks and residential networks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The demand and production of heat for residential district heating is now calculated on a <strong>hourly basis</strong> instead of on an annual basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/hourly_heat_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<ul>
<li>A distinction is made between &ldquo;<strong>must-run</strong>&rdquo; sources and &ldquo;<strong>dispatchable</strong>&rdquo; sources. Dispatchables only run if the must-runs do not produce enough to meet the demand. Their operating hours and profiles are therefore variable. Users can set which heaters start first</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/heat_merit_order_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is now possible to use <strong>large-scale solar thermal plants</strong> for residential district heating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users can choose to turn <strong>seasonal heat storage</strong> &lsquo;on&rsquo;. In that case, overproduction of must-run sources is stored for later use instead of being dumped</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; <img alt="" src="/assets/pages/whats_new/seasonal_storage_heat_en.png" /> &lt;-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Residual heat</strong> from the fertilizer, chemical, refining, and IT sectors can be used and fed into residential district heating networks. View <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/residual-heat-industry">our documentation on GitHub</a> for the method and sources used</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>cost calculation</strong> for heat infrastructure has been improved. Instead of calculating a fixed amount per connection, the costs are now subdivided into indoor costs, distribution costs (pipelines, substations) and primary network costs. The cost calculation has been aligned with the Vesta MAIS model, making comparisons and exchange of outcomes between the ETM and Vesta MAIS easier. View <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/heat-infrastructure-costs">our documentation on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="chps-modeled-differently">CHPs modeled differently<a class="headerlink" href="#chps-modeled-differently" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>All CHPs (with the exception of biogas-CHP) now also work as dispatchable in the electricity merit order, including the industrial CHPs. CHPs are therefore now running primarily for the electricity market. Their heat production is therefore a &ldquo;given&rdquo; (must-run) for heat networks. Previously, CHPs were uncontrollable and ran with a fixed, flat production profile. This change may have an impact on your scenario outcomes!</p>
<h2 id="wind-load-curves-improved">Wind load curves improved<a class="headerlink" href="#wind-load-curves-improved" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>

<h2 id="data-export-adjusted_1">Data export adjusted<a class="headerlink" href="#data-export-adjusted_1" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The format of the load and price curves of electricity has recently changed. For each column in the data export the extension &ldquo;input&rdquo; or &ldquo;output&rdquo; is used to indicate whether the data represents demand or supply of electricity. Flexibility solutions have two columns now, both for the electricity input and output. With these changes, the format of the data exports of electricity, network gas and hydrogen are more consistent.</p>
