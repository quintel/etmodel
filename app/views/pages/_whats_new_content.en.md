# What's new in the Energy Transition Model?

### 1. Improvements in biomass modelling

The modelling of biomass in the ETM has been improved in collaboration with TKI Nieuw Gas, Gasunie, GasTerra and TNO. Using biomass in a scenario is now simpler and more transparent. The improvements allow the user to see at a glance which biomass flows exist for the region, both for the present and the future. In addition, **potentials for various biomass flows** have been investigated by TNO. The ETM now shows these potentials for each region. Another important point of improvement is the addition of **supercritical water gasification (SCW)** and **gasification of dry biomass** for green gas. All required data on biomass and conversion techniques have been adjusted and documented on our [GitHub][biomass documentation] based on research by TNO.

### 2. New large-scale electricity storage technologies

Two large-scale electricity storage technologies have been added: **underground pumped hydro storage** and **large-scale batteries**. Excess electricity from renewable sources can now be stored in these technologies and supplied to the grid at a later moment. The user can adjust the costs of these technologies.
