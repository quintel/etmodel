# What's new in the Energy Transition Model?

### 1. Improvements in biomass modelling

The modelling of biomass in the ETM has been improved in collaboration with TKI Nieuw Gas, Gasunie, GasTerra en TNO. Using biomass in a scenario is now simpler and more transparant for the user. The improvements allow the user to see at a glance which biomass flows exist for the region, both for the present as well as for the future sketched by a scenario. In addition, the **potential for various biomass flows** has been investigated by TNO, which shows how much biomass is available for the Netherlands as well as for a local region. Another important point of improvement is the addition of **supercritical water gasification (SCW)** and **gasification of dry biomass** for green gas in addition to the anaerobic digestion technology. All required data on biomass and conversion techniques has been adjusted and documented on our [GitHub][biomass documentation] based on research by TNO.

### 2. New large-scale electricity storage technologies

For the “Integrale infrastructuurverkenning 3050” (II3050) of Netbeheer Nederland, two large-scale electricity storage technologies have been added: **underground pumped hydro storage** and **large-scale batteries**. Excess electricity from renewable sources can now be stored in these technologies and supplied to the grid later on, once the “excess event” has passed. In addition, the user can adjust the costs of these technologies to simulate other flexibility options.
