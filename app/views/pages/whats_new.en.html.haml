  %h1 What's new in the Energy Transition Model?

  %section
    %h2 1. All RES regions are available!
    %p
      From now on, all 30 Dutch RES-regions are available in the Energy Transition Model. This means that everyone can explore these energy systems and make (professional) energy scenarios. For example, look at the effect of:
      %ul
        %li Placing a solar park in Drechtsteden,
        %li Insulating all terraced houses in Central Holland,
        %li Or building ten wind turbines in the Cleantech region
      %p

    %h2 2. Improvements in user friendliness
    %p
      Work has also been done on the user-friendliness of the Energy Transition Model. A few examples:
      %ul
        %li <strong>Introduction</strong>: There is a clear landing page, where the process for creating scenarios is explained.
        %li	<strong>Saving scenarios</strong>: You can use the ”save” or “save as” function for scenarios. This makes version management much easier and more intuitive. With saving you overwrite the scenario and the name and link remains intact. With “save as” you make a copy, to which you must give a new name (= the same as the old way).
        %li <strong>Supply sliders</strong>: The supply is now in MW and not in ‘units’, this makes it easier for many people to convert known plans and objectives into sliders, without the need for conversions themselves.
        %li <strong>Residences</strong>: You do not have to state per type of residence in a scenario, what type it will be. If you build more houses, the current mix will be used as default. You can change this mix.

    %h2 3. Update all hourly curves
    %p
      The ETM models supply and demand of electricity and hydrogen on an hourly basis. We have reviewed all profiles in close cooperation with the energy modelling community and clearly documented the sources and methods on Github. This process was concluded with a mini symposium where the results were presented, and we identified areas for improvement.
      %a(href="https://github.com/quintel/documentation/blob/master/general/curves.md")
        The documentation on all hourly curves can be found here.

    %h2 4. Multi-year charts
    %p
      The new multi-year charts module allows the user to explore the possible transition paths to a 2050 scenario and discover the actions and consequences for aspired goals in 2023, 2030 and 2040. The charts provide insights into the transition paths of the most important aspects of the energy system (final energy demand, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and renewables). For each of the years the user is able to edit the slider settings. At the end of the exploration the sessions can be saved and shared.

    %h2 5. Other updates
    %p
      Furthermore there are two smaller updates that are worth mentioning:
      %ul
        %li <strong>Non-energetic demand chemical industry</strong>: It is possible to adjust the non-energetic demand in the chemical industry. For example fossil carriers can be substituted by biomass/hydrogen.
        %li <strong>Added hydrogen plant (CCGT)</strong>
