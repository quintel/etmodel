  %h1 What's new in the Energy Transition Model?

  %section
    %h2 1. All RES regions available!
    %p
      From now on, all 30 Dutch RES-regions are available in the Energy Transition Model. This means that everyone can explore these energy systems and make (professional) energy scenarios. For example, look at the effect of:
      %ul
        %li Placing a solar park in Drechtsteden,
        %li Insulating all terraced houses in Central Holland,
        %li Or building ten wind turbines in the Cleantech region
      %p

    %h2 2. User friendliness improvements
    %p
      Work has also been done on the user friendliness of the Energy Transition Model. A few examples:
      %ul
        %li <strong>Introduction</strong>: There is a clear <a href="/scenario/overview/introduction/how-does-the-energy-transition-model-work">landing page</a>, where the process for creating scenarios is explained.
        %li <strong>Saving scenarios</strong>: You can use the ”save” or “save as” function for scenarios. This makes version management much easier and more intuitive. By using the "save" function you overwrite the scenario while the name and link remain intact. Using “save as” allows you to make a copy, for which you must provide a new name (= similar to the old way of saving a scenario).
        %li <strong>Supply sliders</strong>: The units of the supply sliders changed from "units" to MW, which makes it easier for many people to translate known plans and objectives into slider settings, without the need for conversions themselves.
        %li <strong>Residences</strong>: Changes in numbers of residences do not have to be set per type of residence anymore. An increase in the total number of residences automatically increases the numbers of different residence types, based on the current (default) mix. This mix of residence types can be changed by the user. <a href="/scenario/demand/households/population-housing-stock">Check out the new residences sliders.</a>

    %h2 3. Imported electricity price curve
    %p
      Instead of the
      %a(href="/scenario/costs/electricity_import_costs/costs-of-imported-electricity")<
        price of imported electricity
      being constant throughout the
      year, you may now choose to upload a CSV file which can describe a custom
      price for each hour (of which there are 8,760 per year). The position of
      imported electricity in the merit order will change by the hour depending
      on how competitive it is relative to domestic generation technologies.

    %p
      %a(href="https://github.com/quintel/documentation/blob/master/general/costs_imported_electricity.md#uploaded-price-curves")<
        Our documentation
      contains more information on this feature, including instructions on how
      to format your CSV file.

    %h2 4. Update all hourly curves
    %p
      The ETM models supply and demand of electricity and hydrogen on an hourly basis. We have reviewed all profiles in close cooperation with the energy modelling community and clearly documented the sources and methods on Github. This process was concluded with a mini symposium where the results were presented, and we identified areas for improvement.
      %a(href="https://github.com/quintel/documentation/blob/master/general/curves.md")
        The documentation on all hourly curves can be found here.

    %h2 5. Multi-year charts
    %p
      The new multi-year charts module allows the user to explore the possible transition paths to a 2050 scenario and discover the actions and consequences for aspired goals in 2023, 2030 and 2040. The charts provide insights into the transition paths of the most important aspects of the energy system (final energy demand, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and renewables). For each of the years, the user is able to edit the slider settings.
      %a(href="https://pro.energytransitionmodel.com/multi_year_charts")

    %h2 6. Other updates
    %p
      Furthermore, there are two smaller updates that are worth mentioning:
      %ul
        %li <strong>Non-energetic demand chemical industry</strong>
        It is possible to adjust the non-energetic demand in the chemical industry. For example, fossil carriers can be substituted by biomass/hydrogen <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/chemicals">with the new sliders</a>.
        %li <strong>Hydrogen plant (CCGT)</strong>
        Besides the peak load hydrogen plant, it is also possible to use a <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/hydrogen-plants">base load hydrogen plant (CCTG)</a> in a scenario.
