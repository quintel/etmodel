    interconnector_intro_html: |
      By default, the ETM assumes that the external electricity price and availability of import and export, set with
      the sliders above, are constant throughout the year. You may override this assumption by uploading CSV files
      below containing an hourly changing price or availability. </br></br>
      Click on the drop-down icon to change which curve you want to upload. For more information on how this
      works, and examples of compatible CSV files, please <a href=%{docs_path} target="_blank">see our documentation</a>.
    coupled_interconnector_intro_html: |
      When the interconnector's behaviour is set by an external model, it no longer responds to supply
      and demand of electricity based on the electricity price in the external market. Instead,
      import and export become must-run and are set by the uploaded must-run profiles, which
      determine the full load hours, and by the interconnector capacity. </br></br>

        help: |
          Customise the hourly availability by specifying a value between 0 and 1 for each hour. A
          value of 0 means that none of the capacity is available; a value of 0.5 means 50% is
          available; and 1 means all the capacity is available. Any value between 0 and 1 is
          permitted.

        help: |
          You can use your own supply profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain
          8760 rows (one for each hour per year). The sum of the profile should equal the total
          annual number of full load hours of the technology. This means that for each hour the
          profile should contain a value between 0 and 1 specifying the fraction of peak capacity
          used in that hour.
      price:
        default: Default price curve
        type: Price curve
        help: |
          By default, it is assumed that the price is constant throughout the year.
          You can change this by uploading a CSV file, specifying the price of imported
          electricity for every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year) with a price in €/MWh.
        value: "€%{value}/MWh"
        curve_from_scenario: Curve from scenario
        imported_from: From scenario
      temperature:
        default: Default temperature curve
        type: Temperature curve
        help: |
          You can change the temperature curve by uploading a CSV file, specifying the outdoor air temperature for
          every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows (one for each hour per year)
          with a temperature in °C.
        value: "%{value}°C"
      profile:
        default: Default profile
        type: Profile
        help: |
          You can use your own profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year). The unit used in the CSV file does not matter: the ETM will
          use the shape of your profile (the relative distribution of demand over time).
