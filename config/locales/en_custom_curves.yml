      By default, the ETM assumes that the external electricity price and availability of import and export, set with 
      the sliders above, are constant throughout the year. You may override this assumption by uploading CSV files 
      below containing an hourly changing price or availability. </br></br>

      availability:
        default: Default availability
        type: Availability curve
        help: |
          Customise the hourly availability by specifying a value between 0 and 1 for each hour. A
          value of 0 means that none of the capacity is available; a value of 0.5 means 50% is
          available; and 1 means all the capacity is available. Any value between 0 and 1 is
          permitted.
      capacity_profile:
        default: Default profile
        type: Capacity profile
        help: |
          You can use your own supply profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain
          8760 rows (one for each hour per year). The sum of the profile should equal the total
          annual number of full load hours of the technology. This means that for each hour the
          profile should contain a value between 0 and 1 specifying the fraction of peak capacity
          used in that hour.
      price:
        default: Default price curve
        type: Price curve
        help: |
          By default, it is assumed that the price is constant throughout the year.
          You can change this by uploading a CSV file, specifying the price of imported
          electricity for every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year) with a price in €/MWh.
        value: "€%{value}/MWh"
        curve_from_scenario: Curve from scenario
        imported_from: From scenario
      temperature:
        default: Default temperature curve
        type: Temperature curve
        help: |
          You can change the temperature curve by uploading a CSV file, specifying the outdoor air temperature for
          every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows (one for each hour per year)
          with a temperature in °C.
        value: "%{value}°C"
      profile:
        default: Default profile
        type: Profile
        help: |
          You can use your own profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year). The unit used in the CSV file does not matter: the ETM will
          use the shape of your profile (the relative distribution of demand over time).
