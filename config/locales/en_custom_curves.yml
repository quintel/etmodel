          electricity for every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year) with a price in €/MWh.

          It is assumed that the price of imported electricity is constant, set
          using the slider above. You may override this assumption by uploading a
          CSV file detailing the hourly price of imports. For more information on
          how this works, and examples of compatible CSV files, please
