        help: |
          You can use your own supply profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain
          8760 rows (one for each hour per year). The sum of the profile should equal the total
          annual number of full load hours of the technology. This means that for each hour the
          profile should contain a value between 0 and 1 specifying the fraction of peak capacity
          used in that hour.
      price:
        default: Default price curve
        type: Price curve
        help: |
          By default, it is assumed that the price is constant throughout the year.
          You can change this by uploading a CSV file, specifying the price of imported
          electricity for every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year) with a price in €/MWh.
        description_html: |
          It is assumed that the price of imported electricity is constant, set
          using the slider above. You may override this assumption by uploading a
          CSV file detailing the hourly price of imports. For more information on
          how this works, and examples of compatible CSV files, please
          <a href=%{docs_path}>see our documentation</a>.

        type: Temperature curve
        help: |
          You can change the temperature curve by uploading a CSV file, specifying the outdoor air temperature for
          every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows (one for each hour per year)
          with a temperature in °C.
        value: "%{value}°C"
      profile:
        default: Default profile
        type: Profile
        help: |
          You can use your own profiles by uploading a CSV file. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year). The unit used in the CSV file does not matter: the ETM will
          use the shape of your profile (the relative distribution of demand over time).
