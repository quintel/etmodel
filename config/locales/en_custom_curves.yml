      price:
        default: Default price curve
        default_description: |
          By default, it is assumed that the price is constant throughout the year.
          You can change this by uploading a CSV file, specifying the price of imported
          electricity for every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows
          (one for each hour per year) with a price in €/MWh.
        description_html: |
          It is assumed that the price of imported electricity is constant, set
          using the slider above. You may override this assumption by uploading a
          CSV file detailing the hourly price of imports. For more information on
          how this works, and examples of compatible CSV files, please
          <a href=%{docs_path}>see our documentation</a>.
        value: "€%{value}/MWh"

        imported_from: From scenario
      temperature:
        default: Default temperature curve
        default_description: |
          The default temperature curve is based on weather data in the base year of your region.
          You can change this by uploading a CSV file, specifying the outdoor air temperature for
          every hour of the year. This file should contain 8760 rows (one for each hour per year)
          with a temperature in °C.
        value: "%{value}°C"
      profile:
        default: Default profile
        default_description: |
          The ETM contains demand and supply curves for all gas, heat, electricity and hydrogen
          technologies. You can upload a CSV file with your own curve for the selected category.
          This file should contain 8760 rows (one for each hour per year) specifying the
          relative demand per hour or the fraction of peak capacity utilised (depending on the
          chosen category). More information can be found in the description above.
