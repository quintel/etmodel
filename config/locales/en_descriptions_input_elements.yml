        The technology for electric cars is available, but the required infrastructure
        (sufficient opportunities for charging or exchanging batteries) is not. A
        typical electric family car has a range of 150 – 250 km on a full set of batteries,
        which makes them quite suited for small and densely populated countries. Furthermore,
        electric cars are the ideal mobile electricity storage at night, if they are
        plugged in and the charge they hold is remote controlled.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf
        you want to include hybrid cars in your scenario, you could assume that one
        fully electric car is equivalent to three plug-in hybrid cars with range extenders.
        These are electric cars that can be charged from the grid, but have limited

        the battery after about 50 - 60 km. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDo not forget that the

        Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly reduce natural
        gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid management companies to
        reinforce grids. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis works as follows:<br/>\r\nThe gas-fired
        part takes over all of the heating of the building on cold winter days, when
        heat demand peaks. Because of this clever trick, the heat pump has less impact
        on the electricity grid than an all-electric heat pump does. Smart use of
        hybrid heat pumps may therefore avoid the need to reinforce local power grids.
        \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat pumps move heat from one place to another. Refrigerators
        use heat pumps, for example, but buildings can use them for heating and cooling
        too. For optimal results with <em>most</em> types of heat pump, installation
        of under-floor and wall heating instead of radiators is often required, as
        well as good levels of insulation. The <em>hybrid</em> heat pump is an exception,
        because of its gas-fired heater as a fall-back option. Hybrid heat pumps can
        intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or gas-fired heater) is the most
        efficient or cost-effective given the weather conditions and insulation level.
        Houses with limited insulation will rely on the gas-fired part more, better
        insulated ones will make more use of the heat pump.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe COP
        of the electric part of the hybrid heat pump depends on ambient temperature.
        When the COP drops below the threshold value the hybrid heat pump switches

        In the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\" >hydrogen
        production section</a> you can determine how this is done - through steam
        reforming of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) or through green electrolysis.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHydrogen
        cars (in the ETM) are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Hydrogen in consumer
        vehicles is stored at a very high pressure of 700 bar in order to ensure a
        long driving range (of typically 500 km). Hydrogen is fed to a stack of fuel
        cells, where it undergoes a chemical (redox) reaction with oxygen,  generates
        a current and releases water. It thus produces electricity that drives the
        (electric) engine. FCEVs are therefore electric vehicles, but they differ
        from electric vehicles in the sense that the electricity is not stored on
        board in a battery, but instead generated in the car itself. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCombined
        with smart grid systems and energy storage technologies, electric vehicles
        could not only potentially reduce our dependence on fossil fuels but even
        function as a storage medium or production technology. <a href=\"https://www.thegreenvillage.org/projects/hydrolectric\"a>The
        Green Village</a>, an initiative of Delft University of Technology, is doing
        research on how electric cars can be used as more than just an end - for example,
        as power plants and storage devices.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSee the <a href=\"https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/nodes_source_analyses/transport\">documentation

        are a rather novel technology, there is still quite some room for improvement.

    energy_local_electrolysis_hydrogen_share:

      content: "Electrolysis is a hydrogen production process known for many, many
        years. Put simply, by adding to electrodes and applying a current to a container
        filled with water, water molecules are forced to split into hydrogen and oxygen.
        This is an energy intensive process, since current does not travel through
        water easily. Water is made more conductive by using an electrolyte, i.e.
        a substance that when dissolved has a charge and conducts electricity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        various main types of electrolysis differ in electrolyte, temperature and
        pressure of operation. This is a small local electrolysis plant of 0.5MW installed
        at a retail station that produces hydrogen through alkaline electrolysis (based
        on the Hamburg Vattenfall station). Larger, central electrolysis units exist,
        but as of now have only slightly higher efficiencies.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        most promising technique with a significantly higher efficiency, nowadays
        still in R&D phase and coping with a short lifetime and limited capacity,
        is high temperature solid oxide electrolysis. Generally expected to be commercially
        available between 2020 and 2025, it would be a large scale highly efficient
        process that, especially when coupled with renewably produced electricity,

        \r\nDAC allows us to recycle CO<sub>2</sub> indefinitely and yields negative
        emissions as we remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. After that, kerosene
        synthesis and utilisation results in positive emissions, but the net CO<sub>2</sub>
        addition to the atmosphere is close to zero under the assumption that the
        process is powered by solar and wind electricity. In fact, we are creating
        a short-term carbon-cycle. Although research on DAC goes back a long time,
        including missions to outer space, the first companies aiming to build commercial
        DAC units and plants were formed in the 2000s. Currently, DAC is a relatively
        expensive technology. Note that this technology also requires the conversion
        of CO<sub>2</sub> into CO just like when using a CO<sub>2</sub> point source
        and therefor also the PEM technology is assumed.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn this
        model the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction caused by DAC will solely benefit the international
        aviation sector. \r\n<br/>"

        \r\nCompared to using sources of CO<sub>2</sub> for kerosene synthesis, point
        sources of CO have the advantage that no conversion to CO is needed anymore.
        However, CO point sources are not abundant, but can be found, especially in
        steel plants. Another downside is that CO is considered a more useful molecule
        than CO<sub>2</sub>, so it typically already serves some purpose, although
        this is usually combustion for heat or electricity generation. Since it can
        have a higher value, academics and engineers alike have looked into separating
        CO (from flue gases) for synthesis purposes. This is considered more difficult
        than CO<sub>2</sub> capture, as CO molecule size is similar to N<sub>2</sub>,
        but attempts have been successful.\r\n<br/><br/> \r\nIn this model only CO

        \r\nMany industrial and power plants emit waste gasses containing mainly CO<sub>2</sub>.
        There exist various CO<sub>2</sub> separation techniques, of which adsorption
        onto a solvent is most common and thus modelled here. Note that starting kerosene
        synthesis with CO<sub>2</sub> is not optimal; it has to be converted to CO
        before going into the Fischer-Tropsch process. In this model we have chosen
        to use electrochemical reduction for this step, also known as the proton-exchange
        membrane (PEM) technology. \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nThis route is for now a relatively
        cheap way to capture CO<sub>2</sub> in comparison to DAC. It could be an economic
        way of starting up production of synthetic kerosene and start reducing emissions
        by close to 50%. In this model only the steel industry is considered as CO<sub>2</sub>
        point source, although point sources of CO<sub>2</sub> are readily available

        as well as criticised a lot, and as with many choices, their value depends
        on other choices you make. Hydrogen is an energy carrier - not an energy source
        -, so it has to be produced first. In the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\"
        >hydrogen production section</a> you can determine how this is done - through
        steam reforming of methane (a powerful greenhouse gas) or through green electrolysis.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHydrogen
        busses (in the ETM) are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Hydrogen is fed
        to a stack of fuel cells, where it undergoes a chemical (redox) reaction with
        oxygen,  generates a current and releases water. It thus produces electricity
        that drives the (electric) engine. FCEVs are therefore electric vehicles,
        but they differ from electric vehicles in the sense that the electricity is
        not stored on board in a battery, but instead generated in the bus itself.
        \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCombined with smart grid systems and energy storage technologies,
        electric vehicles could not only potentially reduce our dependence on fossil
        fuels but even function as a storage medium or production technology. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSee

        is likely to progress, but will never rival the efficiency of such a process.
        In terms of pollution, one might say that it is better to use gas to generate

      content: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your scenario
        is transported via trucks? Truck transport is flexible and can be scaled up
        or down relatively easily. As such, it is a suitable option when hydrogen
        demand is more dispersed and when volumes are lower. This may for example
        be the case for hydrogen delivery to refuelling stations.

      content: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your scenario
        is transported via pipelines? Pipeline transport can be relatively cheap but
        requires large investments up-front. As such, this option seems to be the
        most viable when hydrogen demand is concentrated and hydrogen volumes are
        large. This may for example be the case if large industrial sites switch to
        hydrogen. In the future it may be possible to repurpose (parts of) the existing
        gas networks, which can reduce investment costs.

    households_heater_hybrid_hydrogen_heatpump_air_water_electricity_share:
      short_content:
      content: "This heater is a combination of an electric heat pump that draws its
        heat from the outside air and an efficient conventional hydrogen-fired boiler.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis
        works as follows:<br/>\r\nThe hydrogen-fired part takes over all of the heating
        of the building on cold winter days, when heat demand peaks. Because of this
        clever trick, the heat pump has less impact on the electricity grid than an
        all-electric heat pump does. Smart use of hybrid hydrogen heat pumps may therefore
        avoid the need to reinforce local power grids. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat pumps
        move heat from one place to another. Refrigerators use heat pumps, for example,
        but buildings can use them for heating and cooling too. For optimal results
        with <em>most</em> types of heat pump, installation of under-floor and wall
        heating instead of radiators is often required, as well as good levels of
        insulation. The <em>hybrid</em> hydrogen heat pump is an exception, because
        of its hydrogen-fired heater as a fall-back option. Hybrid hydrogen heat pumps
        can intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or hydrogen-fired heater)
        is the most efficient or cost-effective given the weather conditions and insulation
        level. Houses with limited insulation will rely on the hydrogen-fired part
        more, better insulated ones will make more use of the heat pump.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        COP of the electric part of the hybrid hydrogen heat pump depends on ambient
        temperature. When the COP drops below the threshold value the hybrid heat
        pump switches to hydrogen. The threshold value can be adjusted in the section

        products to be manufactured (green gas, hydrogen, transport biofuels and more).

        HT ATES is the underground storage of warm water (60-90 degrees Celsius) in
        aquifers. The costs strongly depend on the size of the aquifer and the depth.
        In Denmark, PTES (Pit Thermal Energy Storage) is often used: large insulated
        water basins. However, this is more difficult to apply in the Netherlands
        due to the higher groundwater level."

      short_content:
      content: The default value for the distribution losses slider is typically low
        or even zero for many regions modelled in the ETM. This is mainly due to a
        lack of reliable data for the present year. Please make sure to change this
        slider to a more realistic value if district heating plays a role in your
        scenario. A 15% loss value is a sensible default for new district heating
        systems. For older systems, this is closer to 25-30%.

        larger storage systems, for example, the percentage of losses decrease. On
        the other hand, the losses increase when an open system is used (eg WKO) instead
