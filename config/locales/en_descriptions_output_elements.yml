      content: "Which part of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass is relevant
        to the environment is uncertain and speculative. This chart serves to explore
        the (potential) amount of these emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBesides the official
        UNFCCC accounted  CO<sub>2</sub> emission this graph also shows the CO<sub>2</sub>
        which is emitted due the use of biomass and is (potentially) relevant for
        climate change. Which part of the biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should
        be shown can be set with the sliders in the CO<sub>2</sub> biomass section.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        graph only displays energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are emitted
        in domestic energy use and production. Non-energetic emissions are not included.
        Non-energetic emissions are related to processes other than the production
        of usable energy like electricity or heat. An example of such emissions are
        the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are released from cement during its making.
        The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to the needed energy for cement production
        <em>do</em> count as energetic emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\L\r\nNote: When the
        Fuel Chain Emissions module is turned on, the graph also includes CO<sub>2</sub>
        equivalents of other greenhouse gas emissions, like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
        or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) related to the fuel chain in this graph.
        Non-energetic emissions and greenhouse gas emissions not related to the fuel
        chain are not included."
