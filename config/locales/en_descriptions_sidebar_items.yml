        answer depends on your assumptions about the adoption of new technologies
        and economic or population growth, for example. You can fill in these assumptions
        and the graphs will show how things change. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nHouseholds
        mostly need heat and electricity. Heat use has been steadily decreasing the
        past years, because of better insulation in houses. Electricity demand has
        kept increasing. As people get richer, they use ever more electrical appliances.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        about the adoption of new technologies and economic or population growth,
        for example. You can fill in these assumptions and the graphs will show how
        things change. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe other industry sector is part of industry,
        so changes made here will show up in the charts for industry as a whole."
