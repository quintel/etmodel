        low wind and solar generation combined with demand peaks? Renewable power
        production presents challenges for the security of supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe
        chart to the right shows how reliable power supply is for every hour per year
        in your scenario. In the dashboard below you can see the number of (expected)
        blackout hours due to a lack of power supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nProduction
        technologies vary in their ability to supply electricity during demand peaks.
        Batteries and other forms of storage have fast reaction times but require
        charging and are less suited to bridge long gaps in solar and wind production.
        Dispatchable power plants can supply power at any time but some of them require
        many operating hours per year to cover their costs or are too expensive to
        turn on and off repeatedly.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n(Renewable) gas turbines and
        engines using green gas or hydrogen are promising technologies to provide
        back-up capacity for a future energy system relying on wind and solar power.
        This is due to their fast ramping speeds and relatively low investment costs.\r\n<br
        /><br />\r\n<strong>Tip:</strong> Take a look at the <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/extreme-weather-conditions\">Weather
        conditions</a> section to explore how variations in outdoor temperature, wind
        speeds and solar radiation impact your scenario. Is your scenario able to
        cope with extreme weather conditions? Will people be left in the dark during
        periods of very low wind and solar generation?"

      content: "Generally speaking, electricity generation follows electricity demand.
        The order in which power plants are dispatched is determined by the merit
        order. The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs.
        Those with the lowest marginal costs are dispatched first to meet demand;
        those with higher costs only when demand is high enough. Power plants with
        low operating costs therefore have a high number of operating hours while
        expensive ones may operate as little as a few hundred hours per year. This
        can play a large role in the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your scenario.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBy
        default the ETM calculates which power plants have to be dispatched for each
        hour in the year. This calculation is performed every time you make changes
        to your scenario. You can choose to switch the merit order calculation off;
        when switched off, all power plants will have the same full load hours in
        the future as in the present year of your scenario and these will not respond
        to your assumptions on fuel or other costs. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe merit order
        calculation in the ETM is simplified as it does not distinguish or rank individual

        from wind and solar. Today, the only practical option for dealing with large

        the remaining option is to curtail electricity production. If the installed
        capacity increases, the share of the electricity production that needs to

        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs. Not
        all electricity production technologies participate in the merit order.
        Renewable power from wind and solar has priority, for example, and so
        increasing the share of such technologies in your scenario will decrease
        the operating hours of the remaining plants. Since the merit order is
        determined solely by marginal costs, it is possible that more efficient
        technologies are 'pushed' out of the electricity generation mix this way

        <br/><br/>

        Furthermore, certain technologies are considered 'must-run'. These are
        mainly CHPs that satisfy a certain heat demand and do not primarily run to
        sell power. These must-runplants are therefore not included in the merit
        order. They do influence the operating hours of other plants of course.

        <br/><br/>

        The ETM calculates which power plants are dispatched at each hour in the
        year. The results areupdated every time you make changes to your scenario
        and communicated through various charts. You can download the resulting

        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs.
        Based on the hourly demand, the ETM calculates which power plants are
        dispatched each hour. Combined with the marginal costs of these
        plants, the ETM calculates the hourly electricity price. The ETM

        turned on quickly, has low installation and maintenance costs and uses a fuel
        that is easy to store or transport. For this reason, district heating networks
        often use gas burners as emergency supply in case (part of) the baseload heat
        sources fail. Smaller heating networks are typically connected to a smaller
        number of heat sources which increases the importance of a proper back-up
        system.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Peak demand</b><br />\r\nSome heat sources are
        better suited for supplying demand peaks than others. A heat buffer is able
        to respond quickly to changes in demand, but has to be big enough and needs
        to be filled first. A geothermal heat well is expensive and is therefore best
        used to produce heat non-stop. Burners using (green) gas or hydrogen can supply
        heat at any moment and are therefore a logical choice for meeting demand peaks.\r\n<br

      content: "The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) is dependent on the ambient
        temperature and is depicted by the coefficient of performance (COP). The COP
        becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. Below you can set the
        so-called 'threshold COP': if the COP of the heat pump is below this threshold
        then the HHP switches from electricity to gas. You can choose a setting that
        is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can also choose a
        setting that produces less impact on the electricity network. \r\n</br></br>\r\n
        To help you decide the cost-optimal threshold COP setting from a consumer
        perspective, have a look at the chart on the right. It shows how much it costs
        to make a unit of heat with the HHP for space heating. For the gas part, these
        costs are independent of the COP (and therefore the outside temperature).
        The costs for the electrical part are decreasing with increasing COP (and
        increasing outside temperature). The intersection of the two curves is the
        cost-optimal COP setting for the given cost price gas and electricity. This
        cost price of gas and electricity can be adjusted below. The start value of
        the treshold COP slider matches the calculated cost-optimal threshold COP
        for space heating. \r\n</br></br>\r\n If you're interested in the impact of
        HHPs on the electricity grid, have a look at the chart that is shown when
        clicking on the 'Annual'-button in the right corner of the chart. This chart
        shows the hourly gas and electricity demand of HHPs. If you're interested
        in the share of gas and electricity used by HHPs, have a look at the table
        'Hybrid heat pump gas and electricity shares' in the chart list (Demand ->
        Households)."

      short_content: 
      content: "If a lot of solar PV is installed, this can cause high peaks on the
        electricity network. It is therefore desirable to be able to curtail these
        peaks. In some cases it is smart to connect solar parks to only a certain
        percentage of the peak power. With the sliders below it is possible to set
        the curtailment as a percentage of the peak power. \r\n</br></br>\r\n In the
        chart on the right you can see the effect of curtailment on the peaks of the
        production curves and the yearly electricity production. If you are interested
        in the effect of curtailment on the annual electricity production, have a
        look at the table 'Curtailment of solar PV'. Click on 'see more charts' and
        you'll find the table in the section 'Electricity balance > Flexibility'."

        pump could convert excess electricity into heat for district heating. Other
