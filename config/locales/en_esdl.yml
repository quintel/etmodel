    title: "Coupling energy models with ESDL"
    description: |
      <p>
        The energy transition is a complex challenge. Multiple energy models are used to explore
        different parts of this challenge. A collaboration between these models makes it possible to
        exploit the strengths of each individual model.

      <p>
        The Energy System Description Language (ESDL) has
        been developed to support the communication between the different models - it allows the
        models to ‘speak’ the same language. ESDL can be used to describe information about spatial,
        technical, economical, social and temporal aspects of the energy transition, all in relation
        to each other. This makes it possible for a model to build further upon information from
        another model.
