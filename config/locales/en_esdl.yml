    title: Create a scenario from ESDL
    description: ESDL (Energy System Domain Language) is an xml based language that
      can be used to capture an energy system. The ETM is compatible with most
      energy systems defined in ESDL. The ESDL will be converted into slider
      settings - so you can continue building a scenario or just to see the results
      of your Energy System!
