    title: "Coupling energy models with the Mondaine Suite"
    description: "The energy transition is a complex challenge. Multiple
      energy models are used to explore different parts of this challenge.
      A collaboration between these models makes it possible to exploit the
      strengths of each individual model. In the context of the Mondaine project
      the Energy System Description Language (ESDL) has been developed to support
      the communication between the different models - it allows the models to
      ‘speak’ the same language. ESDL can be used to describe information
      about spatial, technical, economical, social and temporal aspects of the
      energy transition, all in relation to each other. This makes it possible
      for a model to build further upon information from another model.
      <a href=\"https://www.mondaine-suite.nl\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> you
      can find more information about Mondaine and ESDL.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n
      The ETM is compatible with most energy systems defined in ESDL. The ESDL
      file will be converted into slider settings - this makes it possible to
      explore the future energy system in the ETM and allows you to continue
      working on the scenario."
