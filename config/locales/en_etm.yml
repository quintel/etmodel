        Scenario outcomes may change due to improvements in the model, better quality data, or the

      slider_changes_explanation: |
        During updates we must sometimes make small changes to the saved settings for some sliders.
        This is done to ensure that scenario remains compatible with the new version of the model
        and, whenever possible, that the intentions of the scenarioâ€™s author are preserved.

      Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge in 2015, and since then it has received only
      minor maintenance updates. Internet Explorer lacks support for many modern web standards, and
      limits the Energy Transition Model's ability to deliver innovative new features.
