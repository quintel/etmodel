      <h1>The Energy System: what is it?</h1>
      <p>We need energy. This model considers the flow of energy through society (the energy system) from four fundamental questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What boundary conditions do policy <strong>targets</strong> impose?
        </li>
        <li>
          How much energy does society <strong>use</strong>?
        </li>
        <li>
          How much will energy <strong>cost</strong>?
        </li>
        <li>
          How is the energy <strong>produced</strong>?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>These four aspects of the energy system are strongly interconnected, of course. Choose your section of interest or follow the default order.</p>
    demand_text: |
      <p>Who uses energy, for what purpose and where? How will technology change? Will the economy and population grow?</p>
      <p>The answers to these kind of questions determine how much energy society needs. The ETM shows you the impact of your assumptions. Energy costs and policy targets affect energy demand. The energy needed also needs to be supplied, of course. </p>
    supply_text: |
      <p>How our energy is produced depends on the costs of fuel, techological developments and environmental legislation. It also depends on who needs the energy. </p>
      <p>How much energy is produced depends on how much we need.</p>
    targets_text: |
      <p>How much of our energy must come from renewable sources? How much CO<sub>2</sub> can we emit? How much space is available for building windmills or solar panels?</p>
      <p>Governments make laws about the environment and they set all kinds of targets for renewable energy use, CO<sub>2</sub> reductions etc. This legislation is important, because it influences how much energy is used, what kind of energy is supplied and ultimately, how much it costs. </p>
    cost_text: |
      <p>Energy costs depend on fuel prices, but also on how much it costs to build production capacity. Technological advances strongly affects which options are the most attractive.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the cost to society is determined by how much energy is used and what kind of energy is supplied.</p>

      We all need energy every day. Fifty years from now, will energy still be cheap and abundant in the Western World? How can we plan for a future where energy is no longer a commodity? Using verified energy data, the Energy Transition Model (ETM) aims to give you insight into what may happen in the future.
