      The Energy Transition Model (ETM) enables the exploration of possible future energy systems for
      a country, region, or municipality. Select an area and future year to start an energy scenario!
    help_html: |
      To start a new scenario, choose one of the available regions and a year
      in the future. The ETM is available on different geographical levels.
      Is the region you are interested in not in the list? Please
