      The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement means countries are making plans
      to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In those plans, emissions from
      energy use play a big role. The transition of the energy system can take
      different directions, while many options affect each other. The ETM is
      developed to improve everyone's understanding of the energy system in
      order to make more substantiated plans.

      To start a new scenario, choose one of our modelled regions and a year
      in the future. Not sure what to choose? The Netherlands is our most
      detailed region, and 2050 is commonly used when simulating energy and
      climate scenarios.
