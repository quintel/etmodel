      The Energy Transition Model (ETM) enables you to explore possible future energy systems for
      your country, region or municipality. Choose your area and future year to start your energy
      scenario!
    help_html: |
      To start a new scenario, choose one of the available regions and a year
      in the future. The ETM is available on different geographical levels.
      Is the region you are interested in not in the list? Please
      <a href='https://energytransitionmodel.com/contact'>contact Quintel</a>,
      the developers of the ETM, for support.
