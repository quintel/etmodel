      '1987':
        title: '"Dunkelflaute" during extreme cold winter period'
        description: |
          In 1987 the Netherlands faced an extreme cold period from 6 to 21 January:
          the average temperature was -6.5 degrees Celsius. This resulted in a
          significant heat demand increase. In
          the second week of January there was also little wind: a so-called "Dunkelflaute".
          (Full load hours: wind onshore / coastal = 1765, wind offshore = 2905,
          solar pv = 853, solar thermal = 510. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -2.0 degrees
          Celsius)
      '1997':
        title: 'Lack of sustainable energy (incl. "Dunkelflaute") and extreme cold days'
        description: |
          In 1997 the last "Elfstedentocht" took place in the Netherlands. There
          were several extreme cold days with high peak heating
          demands, even in April and October.
          This year also had many periods with scarce sustainable energy generation,
          mainly wind: a "Dunkelflaute" throughout the month of January
          and a calm period in November.
          (Full load hours: wind onshore / coastal = 1759, wind offshore = 3025,
          solar pv = 915, solar thermal = 585. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -0.6 degrees
          Celsius)
      '2004':
        title: 'Excessive and scarce sustainable energy'
        description: |
          In 2004 the Netherlands had several periods with scarce sustainable energy generation
          and in September periods with excess sustainable electricity.
          (Full load hours: wind onshore / coastal = 1937, wind offshore = 3334,
          solar pv = 933, solar thermal = 604. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -0.5 degrees
          Celsius)
