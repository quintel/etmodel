        title: Default (2015)
        description: |
          2015 is the start year of the ETM. The wind and solar curves for 2015
          are based on actual production curves of ENTSO-e. The temperature
          curve is based KNMI-data.
      '1987':
        title: '1987: "Dunkelflaute" and cold winter'
        description: |
          In 1987 the Netherlands faced an extreme cold period during the second
          week of January. This resulted in a significant heat demand increase. In
          these periods there was also little wind: a so-called "Dunkelflaute".
          (Full load hours: wind onshore = 1765, wind offshore = 2905,
          solar = 738. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -2.0 degrees
          Celsius)
      '1997':
        title: '1997: Lack of sustainable energy and extreme cold days'
        description: |
          In 1997 there were several extreme cold days with high peak heating demands in the Netherlands.
          This year also had many periods with scarce sustainable energy generation,
          mainly wind energy. These periods were in January and November.
          (Full load hours: wind onshore = 1759, wind offshore = 3025,
          solar = 792. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -0.6 degrees
          Celsius)
      '2004':
        title: '2004: Excessive and scarce sustainable energy'
        description: |
          In 2004 the Netherlands had several periods with scarce sustainable energy generation
          and in September periods with excess sustainable electricity.
          (Full load hours: wind onshore = 1937, wind offshore = 3334,
          solar = 807. Average temperature difference compared to 2015 = -0.5 degrees
          Celsius)
