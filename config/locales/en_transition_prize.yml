      description: "Create your own personal energy scenario for the future with the Energy Transition Model and win 25.000 euros! <br/><br/>
      <strong>What do you have to do?</strong><br/>
      After creating an account you can determine what you think the Dutch energy system should look like in the year 2030. The policy goals that you have to achieve and costs of fuels like oil and gas are fixed. <br/><br/>
      You can still decide what energy technologies and what mix of fuels you want the Netherlands to use in 2030. Will people still use gas-fired heaters or is everyone going to use heat pumps? Will we build new coal-fired plants or wind farms? Will we drive electric cars or cars with efficient diesel engines? Many options and many solutions. Can you come up with the best solution during this game? If you do, you can win xx.000 Euro.

      Try to achieve all 12 targets at the lowest possible costs. At the bottom right of each screen of the model you can find the goals and whether you have achieved them. At the bottom center of the screen you find the total cost. You can adjust most sliders in the demand and supply sections of the model, but the values for some sliders in these sections and the sliders in the policy and costs sections are locked. The assignment is not easy, it is a challenge! As a team you can find a good solution in a few hours, but is it also the best solution? <br/><br/>
      If you are happy with you scenario, you can save it (press Settings or the disk icon on the upper left of your screen). After this is done, please describe how you think your scenario can be realized in a Microsoft Word file of at most 2 pages (A4). For example, if you filled in that all houses should be insulated in 2030, explain how this can be achieved in reality.<br/><br/>
      After you have saved your scenario, you can upload the document containing your motivation for your scenario. If you have questions during the competition, you can ask them by email: info@energietransitiemodel.nl."
