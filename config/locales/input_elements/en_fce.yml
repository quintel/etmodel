    uranium_from_kazachstan_share:
      title: Kazakhstan
      short_description: ''
      description: Kazakhstan currently supplies the uranium used in the Borssele
        nuclear power plant. The main mining method is in-situ leaching, which reduces
        the amounts of low-level radioactive rock waste, but is associated with ground
        water acidification. Kazakh mining companies are relatively untransparent,
        making it difficult to assess environmental and safety issues.
    uranium_from_australia_share:
      title: Australia
      short_description: ''
      description: Australia is currently the third largest uranium-producing country.
        Australian mining companies employ a variety of mining methods and are considered
        relatively clean. Transportation distances are large, and Australian mining
        companies use relatively high amounts of energy per tonne of uranium ore.
    uranium_from_canada_share:
      title: Canada
      short_description: ''
      description: Canada is home to the most highly concentrated uranium deposits.
        Consequently, the energy required for mining a tonne of uranium is lower than
        in other countries. Canadian mines mainly employ open-pit and underground
        mining methods, which are associated with large amounts of toxic and low-level
        radioactive rock wastes.
    gas_from_nederlands_share:
      title: Netherlands
      short_description: ''
      description: 'The fuel chain of Dutch natural gas involves relatively little
        energy use for transport and low leakage from the grid. Production of natural
        gas is also relatively clean and energy efficient, as a result of energy saving
        measures by the mining sector. Conventional gas reserves are expected to be
        depleted by 2040. '
    gas_from_russia_share:
      title: Russia
      short_description: ''
      description: Transport of Russian natural gas in pipelines is relatively energy
        intensive, because transport distances are so large. Recompression of gas
        in pipelines costs energy, but also leads to leakage caused by the relatively
        poor state of compression stations.
    gas_from_norway_share:
      title: Norway
      short_description: ''
      description: Norwegian natural gas has to cover larger distances than Dutch
        natural gas, so more energy use and subsequent CO<sub>2</sub> emissions occur
        during transport. Because of strict environmental legislation, production
        and treatment of the gas are relatively efficient.
    gas_from_algeria_share:
      title: Algeria
      short_description: ''
      description: Algerian natural gas is transported by pipeline through the Mediterranean.
        Since there are no recompression stations on the sea floor, the pressure has
        to be extra high for the gas to make it across. This means high energy use
        and subsequent CO2 emissions for transport.
    lng_from_algeria_share:
      title: Algeria
      short_description: 
      description: Algeria also exports natural gas as liquefied natural gas. It has
        several liquefaction plants, but Algeria mostly delivers LNG to countries
        in Southern Europe such as France and Spain because of their proximity.
    lng_from_norway_share:
      title: Norway
      short_description: 
      description: Norway is the only country in Europe which has large scale natural
        gas liquefaction facilities. It is relatively close to the Netherlands, so
        energy use and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for transport are relatively low.
    lng_from_qatar_share:
      title: Qatar
      short_description: 
      description: Qatar is the main exporter of LNG worldwide. It also delivers LNG
        to all of the three LNG trading markets, which are Europe, Asia and the Americas.
    lng_from_trinidad_share:
      title: Trinidad
      short_description: 
      description: Trinidad (& Tobago) is a rather small player in the LNG market,
        and mostly exports LNG to the Americas. However, it also ships small quantities
        to Europe, but due to the long distance the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for transport
        are quite high.
    coal_from_south_africa_share:
      title: South Africa
      short_description: ''
      description: 'In South Africa both opencast and underground mining are being
        applied. The emissions for treating the coal are relatively low. Recent studies
        have revealed, however, that the mining sites are heavily polluting the surrounding
        environment. '
    coal_from_north_america_share:
      title: North America
      short_description: ''
      description: Over 50% of mines in North America use opencast mining. Especially
        in the Appalachian a lot of coal is being produced, where mountain tops are
        being dug off. Open cast mining has lower mine gas (methane, a greenhouse
        gas) emissions than underground mining. A common problem is the pollution
        of the surroundings of the mine, caused by ‘Acid Mine Drainage’.
    coal_from_australia_share:
      title: Australia
      short_description: ''
      description: In Australia most coal is produced from opencast mines. The underground
        mines, have a relatively high level of mine gas (methane, a greenhouse gas),
        of which about 50% is released into the air. Environmental policy in Australia
        is comparable to the EU, which implies that the environmental damage caused
        is relatively limited.
    coal_from_eastern_europe_share:
      title: Eastern Europe
      short_description: ''
      description: Poland is one of the few European countries that still produce
        coal. The greenhouse gas emissions for mining are relatively high, because
        a lot of mine gas is present (methane, a greenhouse gas) of which about 50%
        is released into the air. Although Poland is relatively nearby, transport
        emissions are high, because transportation by train is less energy efficient
        per tonne of coal than transportation by large ships.
    coal_from_russia_share:
      title: Russia
      short_description: ''
      description: In Russia the emissions for mining are relative high. Most mining
        is done underground, where a lot of mine gas is present (methane, a greenhouse
        gas) of which about 50% is released into the air. Also the treatment step
        has relatively high emissions. In Russia environmental policies are not enforced
        much and the mines pollute their environment.
    coal_from_south_america_share:
      title: South America
      short_description: ''
      description: Coal from South America comes mostly from Colombia. The main method
        is underground mining and the coal layer contains relatively low amounts of
        mine gas (methane, a greenhouse gas), of which about 50% is released into
        the air. The coal is transported efficiently with large ships. Environmental
        policy in Colombia is not enforced, which means Colombian mines pollute their
        surroundings.
    coal_from_east_asia_share:
      title: East Asia
      short_description: ''
      description: Coal mines in Asia are mainly underground. Until recently China
        was an exporting country for coal, but nowadays uses all produced coal itself.
        Coal is being imported mainly from Indonesia where environmental policies
        are enforced only weakly. East Asia has relatively low mine gas emissions
        (methane, a greenhouse gas).
