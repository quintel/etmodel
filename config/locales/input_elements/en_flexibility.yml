        to the top reservoir. At a later time, when overproduction has ended, the
        top reservoir is emptied and the flow of water is used to generate electricity
        which is returned to the high voltage network. This UPHS has a storage volume

        mostly because fossil kerosene is still available and affordable. However,
        global regulations for aviation are in place requiring airlines to offset
        the growth of their emissions after 2020. This makes it interesting for airlines
        to consider synthetic kerosene. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWith this slider you decide
        how many 1.9 MWe hydrogen plants should be built for synthetic kerosene production.
        This hydrogen is produced through electrolysis and to produce kerosene CO
        is added in the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. Note that only the hydrogen
        production runs on excess electricity and the FT process runs on base load
        electricity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe input of the slider (in MW) is converted
        to a (partial) number of the plant described above."

      description: "What percentage of the carbon comes from Direct Air Capture (DAC)?\r\n<br/><br/>
        \r\nDAC allows us to recycle CO<sub>2</sub> indefinitely and yields negative
        emissions as we remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. After that, kerosene
        synthesis and utilisation results in positive emissions, but the net CO<sub>2</sub>
        addition to the atmosphere is close to zero under the assumption that the
        process is powered by solar and wind electricity. In fact, we are creating
        a short-term carbon-cycle. Although research on DAC goes back a long time,
        including missions to outer space, the first companies aiming to build commercial
        DAC units and plants were formed in the 2000s. Currently, DAC is a relatively
        expensive technology. Note that this technology also requires the conversion
        of CO<sub>2</sub> into CO just like when using a CO<sub>2</sub> point source
        and therefor also the PEM technology is assumed.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn this
        model the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction caused by DAC will solely benefit the international
        aviation sector. \r\n<br/>"

      title: Point source CO
      short_description: 
      description: "What percentage of the carbon comes from point sources of CO?\r\n<br/><br/>
        \r\nCompared to using sources of CO<sub>2</sub> for kerosene synthesis, point
        sources of CO have the advantage that no conversion to CO is needed anymore.
        However, CO point sources are not abundant, but can be found, especially in
        steel plants. Another downside is that CO is considered a more useful molecule
        than CO<sub>2</sub>, so it typically already serves some purpose, although
        this is usually combustion for heat or electricity generation. Since it can
        have a higher value, academics and engineers alike have looked into separating
        CO (from flue gases) for synthesis purposes. This is considered more difficult
        than CO<sub>2</sub> capture, as CO molecule size is similar to N<sub>2</sub>,
        but attempts have been successful.\r\n<br/><br/> \r\nIn this model only CO
        from the steel industry is taken into account.\r\n<br/>"

      short_description: 
      description: "What percentage of the carbon comes from point sources of CO<sub>2</sub>?\r\n<br/><br/>
        \r\nMany industrial and power plants emit waste gasses containing mainly CO<sub>2</sub>.
        There exist various CO<sub>2</sub> separation techniques, of which adsorption
        onto a solvent is most common and thus modelled here. Note that starting kerosene
        synthesis with CO<sub>2</sub> is not optimal; it has to be converted to CO
        before going into the Fischer-Tropsch process. In this model we have chosen
        to use electrochemical reduction for this step, also known as the proton-exchange
        membrane (PEM) technology. \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nThis route is for now a relatively
        cheap way to capture CO<sub>2</sub> in comparison to DAC. It could be an economic
        way of starting up production of synthetic kerosene and start reducing emissions
        by close to 50%. In this model only the steel industry is considered as CO<sub>2</sub>
        point source, although point sources of CO<sub>2</sub> are readily available
        in many more industries.\r\n<br/>"
