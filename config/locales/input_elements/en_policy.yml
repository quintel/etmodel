      title: Max energy imports
      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets the desired level of net energy imports, i.e.
        imports minus exports of energy. <br />\r\nNote: this concerns all forms of
        energy and not only electricity. A separate slider sets maximum electricity
        imports allowed."
    policy_dependence_max_electricity_dependence:
      title: Max electricity imports
      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets the maximum net electricity imports allowed in
        this country. For the grid it is often more important how much import capacity
        exists. \r\n"
    policy_cost_electricity_cost:
      title: Electricity cost
      short_description: ''
      description: This slider sets the percentage by which electricity costs are
        allowed to increase (or decrease).  These costs depend on your assumptions
        in section <a href="/scenario/costs">Costs</a> and the composition of the
        electricity and heat production parks you will design in section <a href="/scenario/supply">Supply</a>.
    policy_area_onshore_land:
      title: Inland wind
      short_description: ''
      description: "Wind turbines require some space. You cannot just build them right
        next to each other, because each turbine produces a wake. In this wake, there
        is considerably less wind energy available to be harnessed by another wind
        mill. How far apart wind mills need to be placed, depends on their height
        and the length of the turbine blades. Typically, wind turbines are placed
        at least 5 turbine rotor diameters apart along a frequently occurring wind
        direction.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis slider sets the total surface area on which
        wind turbines may be built. To see what percentage of the total surface area
        of your country it represents, see the graph on the right. The starting value
        is the current total land area used.\r\n"

      title: Coastal wind
      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets the total length of coastline along which turbines
        may be built. On the right, you can see which percentage of the total coastline
        you have allocated to wind power generation. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWind
        turbines require some space. You cannot just build them right next to each

      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets the total sea surface area in which wind turbines
        may be placed. On the right, you can see how large the total suitable area
        is for wind turbines in your country's territorial waters. The percentage
        of this area that has been allotted to offshore wind power is also shown here.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWind

    policy_sustainability_renewable_percentage:
      title: Renewable percentage
      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets the sustainable energy target as a percentage
        of all final energy use.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe EU has passed binding legislation
        that in 2020 20% of all energy consumption should be sustainable.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPlease
        note: The value that is calculated by the ETM for the current year may be
        different from the number in official statistics due to a different definition.
        This is also the reason for a possible gap between historic and  current value.
