      title: Final biomass use
      description: This chart shows the total bio resource demand within your region
        and relates the demand to the potential of each bio resource category. Everything
        above the "potential line" will come from outside your region. The potential
        could be adjusted with <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/potential-of-biomass">these sliders</a>.

      description: This chart shows all biomass flows in your scenario. Left you can
        see how much biomass originates from outside your region and how much could
        be locally produced. The potential of biomass in your region could be adjusted
        with <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/potential-of-biomass" >these sliders</a>.
    power_shortage_hours:
      label: Power shortage
      title: Power shortage
      description:
        Shortages occur when electricity supply is insufficient to meet electricity
        demand and when it is not possible to fill this gap with electricity import
        or flexible technologies such as electricity storage. The ETM calculates
        power shortages on hourly basis.<br/><br/>
        The table below shows information about the volume, peak capacity and duration of power
        shortages. The volume and peak capacity of the total electricity demand is
        provided to give an indication of the magnitude of power shortages in a scenario.

        emissions that result from the inland final consumption of energy.

      title: Net foreign energy imports
      description: How much energy does your country import or export? The chart shows
        all cross-border imports and exports. The percentage is calculated as the
        total net import (last bar in the chart) divided by the primary energy consumption.

        deviate from national statistics due to different definitions. See our <a

    loss_of_load:
      label: Loss of load
      title: Loss of load expectation
      description: The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is the expected number of hours
        per year that the electricity supply cannot meet its demand. A nonzero LOLE
        does not necessarily result in blackouts as electricity can be imported or
        can be available in batteries. The Netherlands accepts a LOLE of 4 h/yr. We
        distinguish (un)reliable electricity production as volatile electricity producers
        cannot be relied on at all times. <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/loss-of-load-expectation"

      title: Profitability of dispatchable powerplants
      description: |
        The percentage on the dashboard shows which percentage of the installed 
        dispatchable power production capacity is economically viable. This table shows (of all plants, not only the dispatchable plants) what
        plants are profitable or unprofitable in your scenario. For more information about the table please visite 
        the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/cost-main-principles" target="_blank">documentation</a>.
    total_number_of_excess_events:
      label: Excess electricity
      title: Number of hours with excess electricity
      description: As a result of large numbers of wind turbines and solar panels
        installed, the volatile and must-run supply of electricity can be larger than the baseload
        demand. The ETM keeps track of the number of consecutive hours in which this is the case for
        you scenario.
    total_curtailment:
      label: Curtailment
      title: Total curtailment
      description: |
        This gives the total curtailment volume of must-run and volatile producers, also known as 'inflexible' producers (see our
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#categorization-of-flexible-and-inflexible-technologies" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> for more information). Curtailment is applied as a last resort when inflexible production exceeds total demand.
        Curtailing a lot of inflexible production can be a waste of electricity, but it can also be costly to install flexible capacity to use this
        curtailment instead. This dashboard item can help you achieve the desired level of curtailment. </br></br>
        In the chart below you can see the curtailed volume, compared to other uses of flexible electricity demand.
    share_of_curtailment:
      label: Relative curtailment
      title: Relative share of curtailment
      description: |
        This gives the total curtailment volume of must-run and volatile producers, relative to their total electricity production.
        These producers are also known as 'inflexible' producers (see our
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#categorization-of-flexible-and-inflexible-technologies" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> for more information). Curtailment is applied as a last resort when inflexible production exceeds total demand.

    all_ghg_reduction_relative_to_start_year:
      label: Greenhouse gases
      title: Total greenhouse gas emissions relative to start year
      description: 'The ETM calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted
        as a result of energy use. However, there are also non-energetic sources of CO<sub>2</sub>
        as well as other important greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),
        that should be considered. This graph shows these other emissions on top of the energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        resulting in an overview of all greenhouse gas emissions.'
