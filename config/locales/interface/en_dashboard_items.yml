      label: Energy use
      title: Primary energy use
      description: Will you use more or less energy in the future? (Figure depicts
        primary energy demand)
    biomass_final_demand:
      label: Biomass use (final)
      title: Final biomass use
      description: This chart shows the total bio resource demand within your region
        and relates the demand to the potential of each bio resource category. Everything
        above the "potential line" will come from outside your region. The potential
        could be adjusted with <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/potential-of-biomass">these sliders</a>.
    biomass_primary_demand:
      label: Biomass use (primary)
      title: Primary biomass use
      description: This chart shows the total bio resource demand within your region
        and relates the demand to the potential of each bio resource category. Everything
        above the "potential line" will come from outside your region. The potential

    biomass_import_share:
      label: Biomass import
      title: Share of biomass import
      description: This chart shows all biomass flows in your scenario. Left you can
        see how much biomass originates from outside your region and how much could
        be locally produced. The potential of biomass in your region could be adjusted
        with <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/potential-of-biomass" >these sliders</a>.
    blackout_hours:
      label: Blackouts
      title: Number of blackout hours
      description: Blackouts occur when the electricity supply cannot meet the demand
        and it is not possible to fill this gap by importing electricity, because
        of limited interconnector capacity, or by using electricity that is stored
        in batteries. The ETM calculates the hourly electricity supply and determines
        the number of blackout hours from this.

        emissions shown in the dashboard. The chart below shows the CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions that result from the inland final consumption of energy. Also see the <a\r\n  href=\"#\" class=\"open_chart\"\r\n  data-chart-key=\"co2_sankey\"\r\n>sankey

      title: Net foreign energy imports
      description: How much energy does your country import or export? The chart shows
        all cross-border imports and exports. The percentage is calculated as the
        total net import (last bar in the chart) divided by the primary energy consumption.

        input? See our <a

      description: What percentage of all final energy use is renewable? (Number may
        deviate from national statistics due to different definitions. See our <a

    loss_of_load:
      label: Loss of load
      title: Loss of load expectation
      description: The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is the expected number of hours
        per year that the electricity supply cannot meet its demand. A nonzero LOLE
        does not necessarily result in blackouts as electricity can be imported or
        can be available in batteries. The Netherlands accepts a LOLE of 4 h/yr. We
        distinguish (un)reliable electricity production as volatile electricity producers
        cannot be relied on at all times. <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/loss-of-load-expectation"

      description: 'The number on the dashboard shows which part of the available
        dispatchable power production capacity is profitable. This table shows what
        plants are profitable or unprofitable and what plants earn back their operating
        costs (OPEX), but not the required investments (CAPEX). In reality, unprofitable
        plants will be shut down. You can do so too in section ''Supply >> Electricity'',
        but may lose too much reliable capacity. '
    total_number_of_excess_events:
      label: Excess electricity
      title: Number of hours with excess electricity
      description: As a result of large numbers of wind turbines and solar panels
        installed, the volatile and must-run supply of electricity can be larger than the baseload 
        demand. The ETM keeps track of the number of consecutive hours in which this is the case for
        you scenario.
    all_ghg_reduction_relative_to_start_year:
      label: Greenhouse gases
      title: Total greenhouse gas emissions relative to start year
      description: 'The ETM calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted
        as a result of energy use. However, there are also non-energetic sources of CO<sub>2</sub>
        as well as other important greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O),
        that should be considered. This graph shows these other emissions on top of the energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        resulting in an overview of all greenhouse gas emissions.'
