        in the future?\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\t\r\nThe answer depends on your assumptions

      description: "How much land, sea or coast will the government allocate to energy
        production? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nRenewable energy production takes a lot of space,
        whether it is wind power, solar power or biomass production. Governments (national,
        regional or local) need to set aside land for this purpose. Here you can fill
        in how much land is set aside. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNote that setting aside

      description: "Will CO<sub>2</sub> emission costs make the difference between
        renewable and fossil-fuelled power?\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nIn Europe, emitting
        CO<sub>2</sub> is no longer free for energy intensive companies. A decreasing
        number of emission certificates is awarded to them every year, forcing them
        (in theory at least) to become more efficient. In reality, this depends on
        whether politicians will compromise climate legislation for economic gains.
        \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLike fuel costs, therefore, emission costs make up part
        of the costs of fossil-fuelled power. These costs may be (mostly) avoided
        by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Of course, it is only profitable to do

        this has meant first the creation of regional European markets - clusters

        of all European regional markets. In practice, European markets are already
        heavily interconnected and integrated with their neighbors'. This means increasing
        flows of imported and exported electricity. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAt the same
        time, national governments are stimulating the generation of renewable electricity.
        As a result, volatile production (solar and wind) is growing rapidly every
        year. Because electricity is difficult to store, countries with large volatile
        production such as Germany, regularly export excess electricity to neighboring
        countries at low prices.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThese two effects, larger volumes
        of import and export and tighter coupling of the markets, need to be taken
        into account when planning for the future. How can we make the markets perform
        well? What is the influence of renewables on the electricity price? These

        in mind what you have already filled in for the sections 'Demand', 'Costs'
        and 'Targets'. At the bottom of the screen ('Targets'), you can see how many
        of your own policy targets you meet with the current transport fuel mix. If
        you click on it, you will see a table with more details."

      short_description: Will we need more or less energy for bunkering in the future?
        Will people depend more on local products in the future so international trade
        decreases or globalization will keep increasing?
      description: The answer depends on your estimation about the number of international
        travel and international shipping. You can fill in your assumptions and the
        graphs will show how things change.

      short_description: How will the costs of wind power change in the future? Onshore
        and offshore wind are technologically quite different, so they may develop
        separately.
