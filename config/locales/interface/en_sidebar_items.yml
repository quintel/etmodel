        whether it is wind power, solar power or biomass production. Governments (national,
        regional or local) need to set aside land for this purpose. Here you can fill
        in how much land is set aside. \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nNote that setting aside

      description: "Will CO<sub>2</sub> emission costs make the difference between

        CO<sub>2</sub> is no longer free for energy intensive companies. A decreasing
        number of emission certificates is awarded to them every year, forcing them
        (in theory at least) to become more efficient. In reality, this depends on
        whether politicians will compromise climate legislation for economic gains.
        \r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nLike fuel costs, therefore, emission costs make up part
        of the costs of fossil-fuelled power. These costs may be (mostly) avoided
        by Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Of course, it is only profitable to do

        this has meant first the creation of regional European markets - clusters

        of all European regional markets. In practice, European markets are already
        heavily interconnected and integrated with their neighbors'. This means increasing
        flows of imported and exported electricity. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAt the same
        time, national governments are stimulating the generation of renewable electricity.
        As a result, volatile production (solar and wind) is growing rapidly every
        year. Because electricity is difficult to store, countries with large volatile
        production such as Germany, regularly export excess electricity to neighboring
        countries at low prices.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThese two effects, larger volumes
        of import and export and tighter coupling of the markets, need to be taken
        into account when planning for the future. How can we make the markets perform
        well? What is the influence of renewables on the electricity price? These

      description: "This page addresses the biggest obstacle facing integration of
        large amounts of wind or solar power: generation does not necessarily coincide
        with demand. This can lead to both shortage and excess. Large amounts of excess
        electricity cannot always be reliably exported to neighboring countries, especially
        if volatile renewable power takes up an increasing share of production there
        too. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the absence of storage options, the only
        way to maintain grid stability is 'curtailment' or discarding free and renewable
        electricity by turning off wind or solar power generation. \r\nAt present,
        wasting their output increases production cost for wind turbines and solar
        panels and results in increased costs for the whole system. Whether this effect
        will occur in the future is uncertain, since nobody can predict how the market
        will react to scenarios that temporarily produce too much electricity on a
        regular basis. If excess production occurs frequently enough, it might become
        economically attractive to start converting electricity into another useful
        form of energy and integrate it into the energy system. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe

      short_description: Will we need more or less energy for bunkering in the future?
        Will people depend more on local products in the future so international trade
        decreases or globalization will keep increasing?
      description: The answer depends on your estimation about the number of international
        travel and international shipping. You can fill in your assumptions and the
        graphs will show how things change.

        \r\nHydro-electricity's technology is quite mature, but changing rainfall
        patterns make it hard to predict how plants will perform.  "

      short_description: How will the costs of wind power change in the future? Onshore
        and offshore wind are technologically quite different, so they may develop
        separately.
