        This slider affects the costs of imported hydrogen and influences the position
        of hydrogen fired gas turbines in the merit order of the electricity market.
        The costs of domestically produced hydrogen are determined by your choices
        in the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\">'hydrogen
        production'</a> section.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nBelow you can find reference values
        for the current costs of some common hydrogen production technologies (in
        €/MWh hydrogen): <br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Steam Methane Reforming (SMR):
        € 40.5 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) + CCS: € 46.9
        <sup>2</sup></li>\r\n<li>Autothermal Reforming (ATR): € 109.6 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Coal
        gasification: € 45.0 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Electrolysis (wind): € 273.3
        <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Electrolysis (solar): € 747.7 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Combined

        sun (Morocco): € 124.0 <sup>2</sup></li>\r\n</ul> <br />\r\nNote that the
        above numbers are production costs only. To determine the wholesale price
        additional costs have to be taken into account such as transporting hydrogen
        to your area. For tanker ship transport these costs are roughly € 21.0 per
        MWh. <br /> <br />\r\nSources:<br />   \r\n1. Gnanapragasam, N.V. & Rosen

    costs_electricity_fallback_price:
      title: Value of Lost Load (VoLL)
      short_decription:
      description: |
        It should be noted that in reality the VoLL is highly consumer-specific: for 
        some consumers the impact of a disruption in electricity supply is greater 
        than for others. The VoLL should therefore be seen as a aggregate estimate that 
        can change depending on the methodology used and the region for which it is calculated. <br/><br/>
        Additionally, the VoLL is not equal to the expected market price during a loss of 
        load. During these hours, the price is determined by the market cap - if the electricity 
        market has one in place - typically around 3000 or 10000 €/MWh. <br/><br/>
        If your intention is to model realistic electricity prices, you should choose a 
        VoLL that represents the market cap. If your intention is to determine an optimal
        level of investment in infrastructure a VoLL representative for your region should be chosen.

        require these plants to be outfitted with technology to reduce harmful emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe

        This slider sets the change in investment costs for solar power
        compared to current costs. It is expected that solar pv panels will become
        much cheaper in the coming 40 years. Note that this slider changes the investment
        costs for all solar panels that are modelled in the ETM: solar panels on roofs
        and solar PV plants.  Solar PV plants include plants on land, offshore and on land 
        with an integrated battery system. </br></br>
        With the link below you can see the costs of solar panels
        on roofs. Note that the cost of installing solar panels on roofs do not change

    efficiency_energy_power_solar_pv_solar_radiation:
      title: Efficiency of solar panels
      description: "Solar technology is getting more efficient in converting sunlight into electricity.
        This slider allows you to set the future efficiency of solar panels. <br /><br />
        For a standard 1.6m2 solar panel, efficiency and capacity are related in the following way: <br /><br />
        17% efficiency: 272 Wp <br/>
        18% efficiency: 288 Wp <br/>
        19% efficiency: 304 Wp <br/>
        20% efficiency: 320 Wp <br/>
        21% efficiency: 336 Wp <br/>
        22% efficiency: 352 Wp <br/><br />
        <b>Remark 1:</b> The impact of this slider is different for roof top and ground-mount PV.
        For roof top PV, you can set the share of roof surface covered with solar panels in the ETM. Increasing efficiency
        means that the capacity of these solar panels goes up and that more electricity is produced. The number of panels
        installed remains constant. For ground-mount and offshore, you can set the installed capacity in the ETM. Increasing efficiency means
        that less solar panels are needed to meet this installed capacity. Installed capacity and produced electricity stay the same.<br/><br/>
        <b>Remark 2:</b> Please note that this slider interacts with the PV cost slider above. If solar panels become more
        efficient, their price per kW goes down.<br/><br/>
        <b>Remark 3:</b> This slider does not affect efficiency of solar thermal and CSP (concentrated solar power).<br/>"

        storage in salt caverns ranges between 2.5 and 3.4 euro/MWh, while the total
        costs of hydrogen storage in pressurized tanks for example are typically four
        times higher.<sup>1</sup> However, for small energy-storage capacities storage
        in salt caverns is not cost-efficient due to the fixed construction costs.

        (bigger trucks/higher pressure) will only have little influence on the total
        costs. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor the costs calculation an average transport distance

    costs_hydrogen_transport_pipelines:
      title: Total costs H<sub>2</sub> pipelines
      short_description:
      description: "The costs for hydrogen transport through pipelines depend on whether
        already existing gas pipelines will be reused or whether new pipelines will
        be constructed. Existing pipelines could be reused in two ways; the hydrogen
        could flow directly through the pipeline with extra sealings or a new pipeline
        is pushed into the existing gas pipeline, so-called pipe in pipe. This last
        option is about 10x cheaper than constructing a new pipeline and has the advantage
        that material is being reused instead of discarded.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor the
        costs calculation an average transport distance of 100km is assumed. The default
        setting of the slider is based on the construction of new dedicated hydrogen
