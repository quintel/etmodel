        This slider affects the costs of imported hydrogen and influences the position
        of hydrogen fired gas turbines in the merit order of the electricity market.
        The costs of domestically produced hydrogen are determined by your choices
        in the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\">'hydrogen
        production'</a> section.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nBelow you can find reference values
        for the current costs of some common hydrogen production technologies (in
        €/MWh hydrogen): <br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Steam Methane Reforming (SMR):
        € 40.5 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) + CCS: € 46.9
        <sup>2</sup></li>\r\n<li>Autothermal Reforming (ATR): € 109.6 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Coal
        gasification: € 45.0 <sup>1</sup></li>\r\n<li>Electrolysis (wind): € 273.3

        sun (Morocco): € 124.0 <sup>2</sup></li>\r\n</ul> <br />\r\nNote that the
        above numbers are production costs only. To determine the wholesale price
        additional costs have to be taken into account such as transporting hydrogen
        to your area. For tanker ship transport these costs are roughly € 21.0 per
        MWh. <br /> <br />\r\nSources:<br />   \r\n1. Gnanapragasam, N.V. & Rosen

        ATES is the underground storage of warm water in aquifers.

        <a href=\"https://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2125\"
        target =\"_blank\">this report</a> from Ecovat gives the costs per technology below.
        Note: A different technology choice also involves other annual storage losses.
        You can set this <a href=\"/scenario/supply/heat/seasonal-storage-of-heat\" >here</a>
        and the loss percentages per technology are also shown in the text next to the slider.
        <ul>

        <li> Ecovat: 86 €/MWh, 10% losses </li>
        </ul>
        The graph below shows the costs per technology. The costs for the 'heat loss
        compensation' are not taken into account in the costs above as these are
        already included in the ETM calculation when balancing supply and demand.
        The black bars in the graph indicate
        margins of uncertainty in costs due to efficiency bandwidth. The purpose of
        the graph is to clarify the distribution of costs among the various cost items:
        systems with higher CAPEX recover costs at low OPEX, higher efficiency and
        therefore smaller margin of uncertainty.

        For roof top PV, you can set the share of roof surface covered with solar panels in the ETM. Increasing efficiency
        means that the capacity of these solar panels goes up and that more electricity is produced. The number of panels
        installed remains constant. For ground-mount, you can set the installed capacity in the ETM. Increasing efficiency means
        that less solar panels are needed to meet this installed capacity. Installed capacity and produced electricity stay the same.<br/><br/>

      description: "The default setting of the slider is based hydrogen storage in

        quantities of hydrogen over a long period of time. The total costs of hydrogen
        storage in salt caverns ranges between 2.5 and 3.4 euro/MWh, while the total
        costs of hydrogen storage in pressurized tanks for example are typically four
        times higher.<sup>1</sup> However, for small energy-storage capacities storage
        in salt caverns is not cost-efficient due to the fixed construction costs.

        could flow directly through the pipeline with extra sealings or a new pipeline
        is pushed into the existing gas pipeline, so-called pipe in pipe. This last
        option is about 10x cheaper than constructing a new pipeline and has the advantage
        that material is being reused instead of discarded.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor the

      description: "How will the coefficient of performance (COP) of air-source heat pumps change in the future?
      With this slider you can adjust with which percentage the COP of air-source heat pumps for space heating in buildings will change in the future.
      To view the yearly average COP, the so-called seasonal COP (SCOP), you can click on the 'Technical and financial properties'.
      It is not possible to the absolute value of the future SCOP of air-source heat pumps with a slider as this is a result of hourly
      calculations based on the hourly outside temperature curve."
