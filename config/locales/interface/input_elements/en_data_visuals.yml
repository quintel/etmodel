      title: Capacity of wind turbines (per unit)
      description: |
        Set the capacity per unit for onshore wind turbines that you would like to be
        used by the Energy Mix infographic. This slider has no effect on your
        scenario but is only reflected in the energy mix visual.

      title: Large-scale inland wind
      description: |
        This slider sets the share of large-scale wind turbines in the total electricity production of wind inland.
        <br/><br/>
        Note that this slider has no effect on your scenario but is only reflected in the adjacent table and graph. 
        <br/><br/>  
        The output capacity and full load hours of a large-scale wind turbine are listed in 
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="land_use_solar_wind" data-chart-location="side">
        this table</a>.
