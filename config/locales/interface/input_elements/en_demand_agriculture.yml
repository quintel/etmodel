      description: "What percentage of heat demand in agriculture is
        met by oil-fired heaters? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOil-fired heaters are used in greenhouses
        to generate heat. Oil-fired heaters are amongst the least sustainable heating methods compared
        to gas-fired heaters or, even better, geothermal heating systems."

      short_description: ''
      description: What percentage of heat demand in agriculture (greenhouses) is
        met by biomass-fired heaters? <br><br>Burning locally available biomass is
        usually quite efficient.

      title: Water heat pump with TS
      short_description: ''
      description: "Thermal storage works by storing a building's heat underground
        by cooling it with water from a water basin or aquifer in summer and using
        that heat in winter for heating the building. Alternatively the natural heat
        of cold of ground water or roads, for example, can be used.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat
        pumps are more efficient when used in combination with thermal storage, because
        less energy has to be added to cool or heat water to the right temperature.
        It is difficult to realize underground thermal storage in densely populated
        areas."

        With this slider you can install a water-to-water heat pump. This type of heat 
        pump uses a water supply well as a heat source. Only a small amount of electricity 
        is then still required to bring the output water to the required temperature. This makes 
        a water-to-water heat pump much more efficient than an electric boiler.

      short_description: ''
      description: "Geothermal heatâ€™s potential is theoretically huge. This slider
        provides low grade heat (< 100 &#176;C) from several kilometers underground.\r\n"

      title: Gas-fired heater
      short_description: ''
      description: These are gas-fired central heating systems. These systems are
        quite energy efficient, but emit CO<sub>2</sub>.
    agriculture_final_demand_steam_hot_water_share:
      title: District heating
      short_description: ''
      description: District heating is heat supplied by a heat network. The heat can
        be produced by local heat plants / large-scale burners or the heat can be
        imported from outside your region. You can set the heat sources in the Supply-section
        under the header <a href="/scenario/supply/heat" >"Heat networks"</a>.

        on the technologies chosen below.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWhat do you expect the
        development of agricultural electricity demand will be like? This depends
        primarily on the growth of the number of greenhouses (determined by economic
        growth, but also conditions for investment etc.)."

      title: Power-to-heat boiler for gas and H<sub>2</sub> heaters
      short_description:
      description: |
        These power-to-heat (P2H) boilers can be installed as an add-on for
        gas and hydrogen heaters. In hours when the willingness to pay of these boilers 
        exceeds the electricity price, they will use electricity to produce heat and the
        gas and hydrogen heaters will lower their production. You can set the 
        willingness to pay of these boilers in the 
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-heat-for-agriculture">
        Flexibility</a> section. </br></br>
        Note that for this slider to have an effect, capacity of either gas or hydrogen 
        heaters needs to be installed as well. A number of charts are available to help you 
        determine the effect of installing power-to-heat capacity: </br></br>
