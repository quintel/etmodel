      description: "What percentage of heat demand in agriculture (greenhouses) is
        met by oil-fired heaters? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor agricultural heating needs,
        gas is more attractive than the strongly polluting solid and liquid fuels,
        more than in industry. How cleanly such fuels can be applied is a mostly matter
        of scale."

      description: What percentage of heat demand in agriculture (greenhouses) is
        met by biomass-fired heaters? <br><br>Burning locally available biomass is
        usually quite efficient.

      title: Heat pump with TS
      short_description: ''
      description: "Thermal storage works by storing a building's heat underground
        by cooling it with water from a water basin or aquifer in summer and using
        that heat in winter for heating the building. Alternatively the natural heat
        of cold of ground water or roads, for example, can be used.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat
        pumps are more efficient when used in combination with thermal storage, because
        less energy has to be added to cool or heat water to the right temperature.
        It is difficult to realize underground thermal storage in densely populated
        areas."

      description: "Geothermal heatâ€™s potential is theoretically huge. This slider
        provides low grade heat (< 100 &#176;C) from several kilometers underground.\r\n"

      title: District heating
      short_description: ''
      description: District heating is heat supplied by a heat network. The heat can
        be produced by local heat plants / large-scale burners or the heat can be
        imported from outside your region. You can set the heat sources in the Supply-section
        under the header <a href="/scenario/supply/heat" >"Heat networks"</a>.

        development of agricultural electricity demand will be like? This depends
