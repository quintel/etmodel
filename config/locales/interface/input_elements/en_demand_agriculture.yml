      short_description: ''
      description: |
        Thermal storage works by storing a building's heat underground
        by cooling it with water from a water basin or aquifer in summer and using
        that heat in winter for heating the building. Alternatively the natural heat
        of cold of ground water or roads, for example, can be used.
        <br/><br/>
        Heat pumps are more efficient when used in combination with thermal storage, because
        less energy has to be added to cool or heat water to the right temperature.
        It is difficult to realize underground thermal storage in densely populated
        areas.

        With this slider you can install a water-to-water heat pump. This type of heat 
        pump uses a water supply well as a heat source. Only a small amount of electricity 
        is then still required to bring the output water to the required temperature. This makes 
        a water-to-water heat pump much more efficient than an electric boiler. </br></br>

        This slider sets the percentage of agriculture heat demand that is supplied by

        District heating is heat supplied by a heat network. The heat can be produced 
        locally from various sources or the heat can be imported from outside your region. 
        Heat networks are designed to operate at a specific temperature, but different
        networks can have different temperature levels. Go to the
        <a href="/scenario/supply/heat_ht">HT district heating</a> section to determine

        This slider sets the share of useful heat demand from agriculture that is supplied

        This CHP is must-run, which means that it produces both electricity and heat whenever 
        there is heat demand from the agriculture. The production of this plant therefore depends 
        on the installed capacity and the full load hours, and it follows the heat demand profile 
        of the agriculture sector. </br></br>

        This CHP is dispatchable, which means that it produces both electricity and heat depending 
        on the needs of the electricity market and its place in the electricity merit order. See

        documentation</a> for more information. </br></br>
        It can happen that this CHP produces heat even when 
        there is little demand from agriculture. If the total local heat production for agriculture 
        exceeds demand, the excess heat is wasted. In greenhouses this can be done simply by opening 
        windows and venting the excess heat. </br></br>
