      description: "What percentage of heat demand in agriculture is
        met by oil-fired heaters? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOil-fired heaters are used in greenhouses
        to generate heat. Oil-fired heaters are amongst the least sustainable heating methods compared
        to gas-fired heaters or, even better, geothermal heating systems."

      short_description: ''
      description: What percentage of heat demand in agriculture (greenhouses) is
        met by biomass-fired heaters? <br><br>Burning locally available biomass is
        usually quite efficient.

      title: Heat pump with TS
      short_description: ''
      description: "Thermal storage works by storing a building's heat underground
        by cooling it with water from a water basin or aquifer in summer and using
        that heat in winter for heating the building. Alternatively the natural heat
        of cold of ground water or roads, for example, can be used.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat
        pumps are more efficient when used in combination with thermal storage, because
        less energy has to be added to cool or heat water to the right temperature.
        It is difficult to realize underground thermal storage in densely populated
        areas."

      short_description: ''
      description: "Geothermal heat’s potential is theoretically huge. This slider
        provides low grade heat (< 100 &#176;C) from several kilometers underground.\r\n"

      description: These are gas-fired central heating systems. These systems are
        quite energy efficient, but emit CO<sub>2</sub>.

      title: District heating
      short_description: ''
      description: District heating is heat supplied by a heat network. The heat can
        be produced by local heat plants / large-scale burners or the heat can be
        imported from outside your region. You can set the heat sources in the Supply-section
        under the header <a href="/scenario/supply/heat" >"Heat networks"</a>.

        development of agricultural electricity demand will be like? This depends
        primarily on the growth of the number of greenhouses (determined by economic
        growth, but also conditions for investment etc.)."
