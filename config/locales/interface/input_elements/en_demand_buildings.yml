        The average heat demand per square meter is an energy prestation indicator for buildings.
        The indicator concerns the heat demand of the building itself and is therefore not dependent
        on the ventilation system, heating and cooling technologies or PV panels. The better a building
        is insulated, the lower the average heat demand per square meter. This results in a total

        Because the cold stored in a lake goes down drastically during summer the
        year round capacity of deep lakes is small.

        With this slider you can adjust the percentage of air heatpumps used in buildings
        for space heating.<br/><br/>
        An air heatpump uses electricity
        and ambient heat to generate heat. This heat can be transfered to water or air
        and used in underfloor heating or airconditioning systems for space heating.
        Air heatpumps are similar to airconditioners as they both use ambient air and electricity
        to cool the air inside a building. However, older air conditioners are often not
        equipped with the ability to provide space cooling and heating and operate under lower efficiencies
        compared to new air heatpumps. <br/><br/>
        The efficiency (COP) of this heat pump is affected by the outside air temperature
        and therefore determined by the weather. For every hour a seperate efficiency (COP) is calculated based on the
        weather curve available in the ETM. The average of these hourly calculations (the Seasonal COP or 'SCOP') can be found
        in the technical and financial properties. <br/><br/>

      description: "This heater is a combination of an electric heat pump that draws
        its heat from the outside air and an efficient conventional gas-fired boiler.
        Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly reduce natural
        gas demand for heating, while buying time for grid management companies to
        reinforce grids. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis works as follows:<br/>\r\nThe gas-fired
        part takes over all of the heating of the building on cold winter days, when
        heat demand peaks. Because of this clever trick, the heat pump has less impact
        on the electricity grid than an all-electric heat pump does. Smart use of
        hybrid heat pumps may therefore avoid the need to reinforce local power grids.
        \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat pumps move heat from one place to another. Refrigerators
        use heat pumps, for example, but buildings can use them for heating and cooling
        too. For optimal results with <em>most</em> types of heat pumps, installation
        of under-floor and wall heating instead of radiators is often required, as
        well as good levels of insulation. The <em>hybrid</em> heat pump is an exception,
        because of its gas-fired heater as a fall-back option. Hybrid heat pumps can
        intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or gas-fired heater) is the most
        efficient or cost-effective given the weather conditions and insulation level.
        Buildings with limited insulation will rely on the gas-fired part more, better
        insulated ones will make more use of the heat pump.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe COP
        of the electric part of the hybrid heat pump depends on ambient temperature.
        When the COP drops below the threshold value the hybrid heat pump switches
        to gas. The threshold value can be adjusted in the section <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_net_load/demand-response-behavior-of-hybrid-heat-pumps\"

        The COP of the electric part of the hybrid oil heat pump depends on ambient

        switches to oil.
        <b>Note that by default, the oil-fired part
        provides  most if not all of the required heat for space heating.</b>
        This is because the default threshold COP is set at a relatively high value of 3.7
        based on the consumer prices for oil and electricity.
