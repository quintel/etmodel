        This concerns all buildings that fall into categories like offices, hospitals,
        swimming pools, restaurants, etc. Apart from increasing prosperity, this is
        one of the most important drivers for the energy demand growth.

        form of energy and low-grade heat can only be used to heat buildings or make
        hot water. The waste is even bigger if the electricity is generated using
        fossil fuels.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nElectric heaters need to be able to produce
        a lot of heat quickly, so they can have a large impact on the energy grid.
        Especially if they are added to electric heat pumps as extra heating capacity
        during cold days, impact on the local electricity grid can be extreme. If
        you want to see what will happen to the grid you can set the electric heater

        gas-fired heat pumps are roughly as efficient as electric ones.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOn
        cold winter days, gas-fired heat pumps in effect turn into gas-fired heaters,
        since little ambient heat is available. This is vastly preferable to electric
        heat pumps that draw their heat from the outside air (not found in this model)

        pollutants other than CO<sub>2</sub>. A considerable disadvantage is the fact

        tubes. However, their longer life and lower elektricity use will in the end
