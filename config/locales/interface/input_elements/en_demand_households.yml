        This slider adjusts the average heat demand per square meter for apartments built between the present year
        and the future year. Note that the slider value only affects the energy demand of space heating.
        <br><br>
        The average heat demand per square meter is an energy prestation indicator for residences. The indicator
        concerns the heat demand of the building itself and is therefore not dependent on the ventilation system,
        heating and cooling technologies or PV panels. The better residences are insulated, the lower the average
        heat demand per square meter. This results in a total decrease of space heating demand in these residences.

      description: "A heat pump moves heat from one place to another. Heat pumps are
        used in refrigerators, but buildings can use them for heating and cooling.
        For optimal application, it does often require installation of under-floor
        and wall heating instead of radiators. Currently, their use in newly constructed
        houses is becoming quite popular, since European legislation dictates that
        domestic energy consumption must decrease.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis heat pump
        uses a ground source on one side and a wall or floor delivery system on the
        other. Not all residences are suitable for using a heat pump as they cannot
        all be fitted with wall or floor delivery systems at acceptable costs. Considering
        the high investment costs for such delivery systems, it is realistic to assume
        that no more than ~20% of all residences could be equipped with such a heat
        pump. For the other 80%, the costs would probably outweigh the benefits.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nNote
        that for heat pump shares above 20%, the ETM will considerably underestimate
        the associated investment costs. This is caused by the fact that the additional
        investment costs are unknown for installation in residences that would normally
