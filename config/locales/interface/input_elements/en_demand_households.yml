      short_description: ''
      description: "A heat pump moves heat from one place to another. Heat pumps are
        used in refrigerators, but buildings can use them for heating and cooling.
        For optimal application, it does often require installation of under-floor
        and wall heating instead of radiators. Currently, their use in newly constructed
        houses is becoming quite popular, since European legislation dictates that
        domestic energy consumption must decrease.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis heat pump
        uses a ground source on one side and a wall or floor delivery system on the
        other. Not all residences are suitable for using a heat pump as they cannot
        all be fitted with wall or floor delivery systems at acceptable costs. Considering
        the high investment costs for such delivery systems, it is realistic to assume
        that no more than ~20% of all residences could be equipped with such a heat
        pump. For the other 80%, the costs would probably outweigh the benefits.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nNote
        that for heat pump shares above 20%, the ETM will considerably underestimate
        the associated investment costs. This is caused by the fact that the additional
        investment costs are unknown for installation in residences that would normally
        not qualify."

        Essentially, the hybrid heat pump offers a way to strongly reduce natural

        reinforce grids. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis works as follows:<br/>\r\nThe gas-fired

        heat demand peaks. Because of this clever trick, the heat pump has less impact
        on the electricity grid than an all-electric heat pump does. Smart use of
        hybrid heat pumps may therefore avoid the need to reinforce local power grids.
        \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nHeat pumps move heat from one place to another. Refrigerators
        use heat pumps, for example, but buildings can use them for heating and cooling
        too. For optimal results with <em>most</em> types of heat pump, installation
        of under-floor and wall heating instead of radiators is often required, as
        well as good levels of insulation. The <em>hybrid</em> heat pump is an exception,

        intelligently use whichever part (heat pump or gas-fired heater) is the most
        efficient or cost-effective given the weather conditions and insulation level.
        Houses with limited insulation will rely on the gas-fired part more, better
        insulated ones will make more use of the heat pump.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe COP
