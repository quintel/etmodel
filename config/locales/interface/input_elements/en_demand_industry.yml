        In this production route, steam methane reforming (SMR) is first used to produce hydrogen. This causes

        in what is called the Haber-Bosch process. The ammonia is subsequently used to produce fertilizers, 
        most notably urea and nitric-acid. Heat is required at various steps in the process, causing an 
        energetic demand. </br></br>
        CO<sub>2</sub> is produced in the SMR, which counts as non-energetic emissions in your

        Heat is supplied from a collective network as steam. The heat can be produced by 
        combined heat and power (CHP) plants or by large-scale burners. You can set the heat sources in the 
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/steam-network-sources">Steam network sources</a>

      description: |
        These power-to-heat (P2H) boilers can be installed as an add-on for
        gas and hydrogen heaters. In hours when the willingness to pay of these boilers 
        exceeds the electricity price, they will use electricity to produce heat and the
        gas and hydrogen heaters will lower their production. You can set the 
        willingness to pay of these boilers in the 
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-heat-for-industry">
        Flexibility</a> section. </br></br>
        Note that for this slider to have an effect, capacity of either gas or hydrogen 
        heaters needs to be installed as well. A number of charts are available to help you
