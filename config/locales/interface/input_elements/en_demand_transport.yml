        of aviation fuels to aircraft for international aviation. Fuels used by airlines

        included in the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, the direct emissions from aviation
        represent 3% of EU’s GHG emissions and more than 2% of emissions worldwide.
        Some people see the international aviation as a country on its own, if that
        would be the case, then it would rank in the top 10 emitters. (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en\">EC

        to wheels” of good diesel cars and are even more efficient compared to gasoline
        engines. The technology for electric cars is available, but the required infrastructure
        (sufficient opportunities for charging or exchanging batteries) is not. A
        typical electric family car has a range of 150 – 250 km on a full set of batteries,
        which makes them quite suited for small and densely populated countries. Furthermore,
        electric cars are the ideal mobile electricity storage at night, if they are
        plugged in and the charge they hold is remote controlled.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf
        you want to include hybrid cars in your scenario, you could assume that one
        fully electric car is equivalent to three plug-in hybrid cars with range extenders.
        These are electric cars that can be charged from the grid, but have limited
        battery capacity. A range extender is a small gasoline engine that re-charges
        the battery after about 50 - 60 km. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDo not forget that the
        electricity still needs to be generated. If this is done with wind power,
        electric cars contribute strongly to a more sustainable society, but less
        so when coal power is used. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSee the <a href=\"https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/nodes_source_analyses/transport\">documentation

        cars (in the ETM) are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Hydrogen in consumer
        vehicles is stored at a very high pressure of 700 bar in order to ensure a
        long driving range (of typically 500 km). Hydrogen is fed to a stack of fuel
        cells, where it undergoes a chemical (redox) reaction with oxygen,  generates
        a current and releases water. It thus produces electricity that drives the
        (electric) engine. FCEVs are therefore electric vehicles, but they differ
        from electric vehicles in the sense that the electricity is not stored on
        board in a battery, but instead generated in the car itself. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCombined

        a rapid demand in motorcycle usage as this form of personal transport provides
        ease and convenience especially in developing countries where the transport
        infrastructure is not very suitable to cars and other larger vehicles. Currently,
        almost all of the motorcycles run on gasoline, however as zero-emissions technologies

        used very often. Competition with cars at charging stations as well as a smaller
        market audience as compared to cars may be some among the reasons which is
        holding back the number of electric motorcycles on the road. However, new
        innovative electric motorcycles are entering the market, which could potentially
        be a hype. Especially areas with high population densities could benefit from
        an increase in electric motorcycles, as motorcycles in such areas comprise
        quite a significant share of the road transport. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSee the

        can also run in a dual fuel mode in which they use both diesel and LNG. In
        this dual fuel mode, the actual fuel usage can vary from 100% diesel to 1%
        diesel / 99% LNG. In the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/transport_fuels/domestic-navigation\"
