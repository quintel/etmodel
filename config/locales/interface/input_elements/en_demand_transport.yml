        is included in this scenario, including all transport fuels refueled for
        international flights. International transport is not included in the
        ETM by default: the slider is therefore set to zero by default.<br/><br/>

    transport_plane_using_kerosene_mix_share:
      title: Kerosene (mix)
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the percentage of total passenger kilometers in domestic
        aviation that are traveled by airplane using kerosene mix.<br/><br/>
        Kerosene is the most dominant fuel in aviation due to its high energy content and
        low freezing point. This means that airplanes can cover long distances and the
        kerosene does not solidify when flying at high altitude. <br/><br/>
        The share of kerosene and biokerosene in the kerosene mix can be set in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/domestic-aviation">Transport fuels</a> section.
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/overview">
        Liquid fuels and feedstock</a> section to set the production of (bio)kerosene.

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the percentage of total passenger kilometers in domestic
        aviation that are traveled by airplanes using bio-ethanol.<br/><br/>
        The energy content of bio-ethanol is lower than that of kerosene and the production
        of bio-ethanol is limited. Therefore, bio-ethanol is rarely used for
        airplanes. With a (modified) combustion engine, airplanes can complete their flight
        exclusively on biofuels.<br/><br/>
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/overview">
        Liquid fuels and feedstock</a> section to set the production of bio-ethanol.

        This slider sets the percentage of total passenger kilometers in domestic
        aviation that are traveled by airplanes using gasoline.<br/><br/>
        Gasoline is mainly used in smaller airplanes. Due to the lower energy content
        compared to kerosene, airplanes using gasoline can cover limited distances.<br/><br/>

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the percentage of total passenger kilometers in domestic
        aviation that are traveled by electric airplanes.<br/><br/>
        Electric airplanes have an electric motor and batteries, making them
        twice as efficient as combustion engines. Electric airplanes are still in a
        development phase as current technology is not suitable for large
        airplanes covering long distances.

        This slider sets the percentage of total passenger kilometers in domestic
        aviation that are traveled by airplanes using hydrogen.<br/><br/>
        Airplanes using hydrogen use fuel cells. A fuel cell in combination with an electric motor
        is approximately twice as efficient compared to a combustion engine. Hydrogen airplanes
        are still in a development phase as the hydrogen infrastructure is still insufficient to
        meet the demand.<br/><br/>

        This slider determines what percentage of car passenger kilometers is traveled by cars
        running on compressed natural gas (CNG).<br/><br/>
        Cars running on CNG emit less CO<sub>2</sub> than both gasoline and LPG cars.
        Moreover, it is possible to blend in green gas, which further reduces the environmental
        impact.<br/><br/>
        Go to the

        This slider determines what percentage of cargo ton-kilometers by trucks is
        traveled by trucks running on liquefied natural gas (LNG). <br/><br/>
        Trucks using LNG can travel further on a tank than trucks using CNG, due to the higher

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider determines what percentage of fuel consumption in international
        shipping is supplied by methanol.<br/><br/>
        Methanol has potential as an alternative to HFO due to lower emissions of
        sulfur oxides and particulate matter. Depending on the production method of methanol,
        methanol ships can substantially reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        from shipping.<br/><br/>

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider determines what percentage of fuel consumption in international
        shipping is supplied by ammonia. <br/><br/>
        Like hydrogen-powered ships, ammonia-powered ships are a fairly new
        technology. The main advantage of ammonia over hydrogen is that
        ammonia can be stored more easily because it is liquid at a temperature
        much closer to zero than hydrogen. This makes the storage of liquid ammonia
        less energy-intensive.<br/><br/>
        The ETM assumes by default that ammonia is produced on-site in the
         <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers">fertilizer sector</a>. This local
         production can be replaced by import of ammonia, which can be set in the

        Diesel trains are still fairly common because they do not depend on
        electrical infrastructure. This makes them suitable for remote

        This slider determines what percentage of domestic shipping freight tonne-kilometres is
        carried out by vessels with diesel engines. <br/><br/>
        Inland vessels are typically powered by conventional diesel engines.
        However, dual-fuel engines are also available which can switch between two fuels, typically
        liquefied natural gas (LNG) and diesel. In addition, more advanced multi-fuel engines are in
        development which, besides LNG and diesel, can also use fuels such as bio-ethanol. <br/><br/>
        This slider sets the combined share of all diesel engine types. The combined fuel mix can be
        configured in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/domestic-navigation">Transport fuels</a>

        This slider determines what percentage of domestic shipping freight tonne-kilometres is carried out
        by vessels powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). <br/><br/>
        LNG is an emerging fuel in the shipping sector and can be a suitable alternative to diesel
        due to its high energy density and lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Furthermore, burning LNG
        results in lower emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>x</sub> and particulate matter.<br/><br/>
        LNG for domestic shipping can consist of a mix of LNG and bio-LNG. Go to

        Hydrogen-powered vessels are a new technology that is still under development.
        Depending on the hydrogen production method, the use of hydrogen in shipping can contribute
        to decarbonisation.<br/><br/>

        for onshore power supply (OPS). <br/><br/>
        Electric vessels are a new technology still in development. Due to the size of the
        vessels and the long distances they cover, it is likely that these vessels will rely on
        large battery systems.
    transport_ship_using_ammonia_share:

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider determines what percentage of domestic shipping freight tonne-kilometres is
        carried out by vessels running on ammonia. <br/><br/>
        Like hydrogen-powered ships, ammonia-powered ships are a relatively new technology.
        The main advantage of ammonia compared to hydrogen is that it is easier to store because it
        is liquid at a temperatures much closer to zero than hydrogen. This makes storage of liquid
        ammonia less energy-intensive.<br/><br/>
        The ETM assumes by default that ammonia is produced on-site in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers">fertilizer sector</a>. This local production
        can be replaced by ammonia import, which can be configured in the

       This slider determines what percentage of domestic shipping freight tonne-kilometres is carried
       out by vessels powered by methanol. <br/><br/>
       Methanol has potential as an alternative to diesel vessels due to its lower emissions of
       sulphur oxides and particulate matter. Depending on the production method of methanol,
       methanol-powered vessels can substantially reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the shipping
       sector.<br/><br/>
       The methanol used may consist of fossil, synthetic and biomethanol.
       Go to <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/international-navigation">
