        included in the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, the direct emissions from aviation
        represent 3% of EU’s GHG emissions and more than 2% of emissions worldwide.
        Some people see the international aviation as a country on its own, if that
        would be the case, then it would rank in the top 10 emitters. (<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en\">EC

        Kerosene is the most dominant fuel used in aviation due to its high energy content and
        low freezing temperature. This means planes can fly large distances and
        the kerosene does not solidify when flying on high altitudes. </br></br>

        Bio-ethanol or other types of bio-based fuels are derived from plants or waste. The energy content
        of bio-ethanol is lower compared to kerosene and production is limited. This explains
        the current infrequent use of bio-ethanol in airplanes. Using a (modified) combustion engine airplanes

        What percentage of all cars will be electric cars in the future? <br/><br/>
        Electric cars typically use less energy than the “well to wheels” fuel consumption
        of cars with internal combustion engines, such as diesel or gasoline cars. </br></br>
        If you want to include hybrid cars in your scenario, you could assume that one
        fully electric car is equivalent to three plug-in hybrid cars with range extenders.
        These are electric cars that can be charged from the grid, but have limited
        battery capacity. A range extender is a small gasoline engine that re-charges
        the battery once it's depleted. </br></br>
        It is important to note that the electricity used by electric cars still needs to
        be generated somewhere. If this is done with wind power, electric cars contribute
        strongly to a more sustainable society, but less so when coal power is used.

        relatively clean compared to gasoline or diesel fueled ones. In terms of efficiency,
        one might say that gas is better used for generating heat and electricity
        (co-generation) at the location it is needed. ICE technology is likely to
        progress, but will never rival the efficiency of such a process. In terms
        of pollution, one might say that it is better to use gas to generate electricity
        at a central location (where exhaust gases can be cleaned or even captured
        and stored) and to use the electricity to power electric cars.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCompressed

        cars (in the ETM) are fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). Hydrogen in consumer
        vehicles is stored at a very high pressure of 700 bar in order to ensure a
        long driving range (of typically 500 km). Hydrogen is fed to a stack of fuel
        cells, where it undergoes a chemical (redox) reaction with oxygen,  generates
        a current and releases water. It thus produces electricity that drives the
        (electric) engine. FCEVs are therefore electric vehicles, but they differ
        from electric vehicles in the sense that the electricity is not stored on
        board in a battery, but instead generated in the car itself. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCombined
        with smart grid systems and energy storage technologies, electric vehicles
        could not only potentially reduce our dependence on fossil fuels but even
        function as a storage medium or production technology. <a href=\"https://www.thegreenvillage.org/projects/hydrolectric\"a>The

        It is technically possible to produce carbon-free hydrogen. Switching to hydrogen-powered aviation
        therefore offers a way to decarbonize transport by planes. How much emissions you actually reduce

        It is technically possible to produce carbon-free ammonia. Switching to ammonia-powered shipping

        Compared to hydrogen-powered ships the main benefit of using ammonia is that it's easier to store.
        Ammonia turns liquid at a temperature much closer to zero than hydrogen, making liquefied storage
        of ammonia less energy-intensive. Alternatively, compressed ammonia has a substantialy
        higher volumetric energy density than hydrogen at the same pressure, meaning that it takes
        up less space to transport the same amount of fuel.

        (Liquefied) natural gas engines are a rather novel ship engine

        can only run on LNG but have superior performance to dual fuel engines. On
        the other hand, dual fuel engines allow for more flexibility, being less dependent
        on the availability of shipping fuels.</br></br>
