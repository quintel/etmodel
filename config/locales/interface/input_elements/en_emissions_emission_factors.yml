      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of imported heat
      short_description:
      description: "How much CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are associated with imported
        heat? \r\n</br></br>\r\nThis strongly depends on the heat source. For reference:
        when heat originates from a gas CCGT plant, the emissions are around 36.0
        kg/GJ (<a href=\"https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/lijst-emissiefactoren\"
        >source</a> in Dutch)."

      title: Hydrogen
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the emission factor of imported hydrogen. The emissions factor for
        imported hydrogen highly depends on the technologies that are used for hydrogen
        production.<br/><br/>
        The ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the area where the energy
        is <i>used</i>, rather than the <i>location</i> of the emissions. This is why
        emissions associated with hydrogen production are allocated to scenarios by default
        for imported hydrogen. See the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emission-factors#imported-carriers"

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the emission factor of imported liquid hydrogen. The emissions factor for
        imported liquid hydrogen highly depends on the technologies that are used for liquid
        hydrogen production.<br/><br/>
        The ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the area where the energy
        is <i>used</i>, rather than the <i>location</i> of the emissions. This is why

    co2_emissions_of_imported_lohc_future:
      title: LOHC
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the emission factor of imported Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC).
        The emissions factor for imported LOHC highly depends on the technologies that are used for
        LOHC production.<br/><br/>
        The ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the area where the energy
        is <i>used</i>, rather than the <i>location</i> of the emissions. This is why
        emissions associated with LOHC production are allocated to scenarios by default

        This slider sets the emission factor of imported ammonia. The emissions factor for
        imported ammonia highly depends on the technologies that are used for ammonia
        production.<br/><br/>
        The ETM allocates CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the area where the energy
        is <i>used</i>, rather than the <i>location</i> of the emissions. This is why
        emissions associated with ammonia production are allocated to scenarios by default
