      description: "In the chemical industry there are different non-energetic processes in which CO<sub>2</sub>
      is emitted. For example in the production of ammonia for agricultural activities and
      in the production of petrochemical products and other chemical products. With this slider you can determine
      how these emissions will change in the future.
      <br/><br/>Please note: The non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the fertilizer industry are not part of this slider.
      These emissions are calculated by the ETM based on the use of feedstock of this sector (non-energetic demand for network gas). Similarly, emissions from hydrogen supplied via (centralised) hydrogen infrastructure are not included in this slider. The ETM calculates these emissions based on the chosen production technologies for hydrogen.
