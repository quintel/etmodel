        Electricity, hydrogen and CO<sub>2</sub> can be used to produce syngas, which can subsequently be
        used in the Fischer-Tropsch process to produce synthetic transport fuels and chemical feedstock. In the ETM,
        capacity of this technology can be set as a flexible demand technology, which means
        that there is only production when the willingness to pay for electricity for the production process
        exceeds the hourly electricity price. </br></br>

        Due to the volatile nature of wind power electricity_share, the impact of installing large
        numbers of wind turbines on the electricity grid can be large. To reduce the
        impact on the electricity grid, wind turbines with a battery system have a connection
        to the grid that is reduced in capacity compared to the installed capacity. <br/><br/>
        The grid connection capacity is set relative to the installed capacity of the
        wind turbines with battery systems. This means that if you change the installed
        capacity in the <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity_renewable/wind-turbines">

        specified by this slider. <br/><br/>
        Any production by the wind turbines that exceeds the grid connection capacity
        will have to be consumed by the integrated battery system, for which you can
        determine the relative capacity with the slider below. If the battery cannot
        consume any more electricity due to charging capacity or volume constraints,
        the excess electricity production will be curtailed.

        The battery system only consumes electricity when the production exceeds the grid
        connection capacity threshold and starts to release it again when the production drops
