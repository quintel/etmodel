        the gas. In theory, it is possible to substitute 100% of the gas in this way

        for a couple of years now, and its popularity has declined strongly. Future
        international regulation of bio-oil production may mean bio-oil will be used
        more often.  \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nAt the bottom of each page, you can see how
        much arable land you need world-wide to grow all the required biomass.\r\n"

      short_description: ''
      description: 'Bio-coal is a fuel with properties sufficiently similar to coal
        that it be used as a substitute. It is made by torrefaction of woody biomass.
        Torrefaction of biomass occurs at temperatures of several hundred &#8451;
        in the absence of oxygen.  '

      description: 'Wet biomass is biomass with a moisture percentage of at least

      title: Dry biomass
      short_description:
      description: 'Dry biomass consists of relatively dry organic material, like
        wood. Dry biomass is ''simple biomass'': it requires no processing and provides
        a high return. There is therefore a great demand for clean, woody biomass.
        Examples of woody biomass are residual streams from forestry (tree tops, stumps,
        bark, branches), recycled waste wood, residual streams from agriculture (straw),
        and fast-growing bio-energy crops (elephant grass, willow, poplar).'

      short_description:
      description: 'Oil-containing biomass is biomass with seeds that contain oil.
        Crude biodiesel is produced by pressing oil seeds. This can be converted into
        biodiesel in an esterification process with the addition of methanol. Examples
        of oil-containing biomass are: rapeseed, sunflower seeds, oil palm. Used frying
        fats also fall within this category.'

      short_description:
      description: "Currently green gas is mostly generated from the anaerobic digestion
        of organic biomass and residues produced in agriculture, food production and
        waste processing. There are two methods for biomass digestion: mono-digestion
        (one residual flow) or co-digestion (multiple flows with at least 50% animal
        manure). After digestion the produced biogas can be either used directly for
        power and/or heat generation or can be converted into green gas to make it
        suitable for the gas network.\r\n</br></br>\r\nThe ETM models one general
        type of digester that digests wet biomass. The specifications of this technology
        can be found below."

      title: Dry biomass gasification
      short_description:
      description: During dry gasification dry biomass is gasified at high temperatures
        (800 to 1000 °C), a kind of combustion with a lack of oxygen. The formation
        of a synthesis gas is central to gasification. This synthesis gas is a flammable
        mixture of methane, hydrogen, CO<sub>2</sub> en CO. The gasification route
        offers flexibility when it comes to the possible follow-up routes and end
        products to be manufactured (green gas, hydrogen, transport biofuels and more).
        In the case of green gas production, gasification is followed by methane synthesis,
        and reprocessing into green gas of natural gas quality.

      title: Wet biomass gasification (SCW)
      short_description:
      description: Wet gasification is also called Super Critical Water gasification
        (SCW). During SCW wet biomass is converted into green gas under high pressure
        and temperature (at least 375 °C and 221 bar). Above this critical point,
        water achieves supercritical conditions. During this phase all organic molecules
        within the biomass fall apart en reach a new balance in the form of synthesis
        gas (methane, hydrogen, CO<sub>2</sub> and CO) (Gasunie, 2019). Inorganic
        substances crystallize out simultaneously so that they can be recovered.
