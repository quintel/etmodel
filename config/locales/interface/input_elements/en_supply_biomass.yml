      short_description: ''
      description: "This slider sets what percentage of fuel for industry CHPs is
        bio-oil . The oil is injected into the furnace as a fine mist together with
        the gas. In theory, it is possible to substitute 100% of the gas in this way
        without losing efficiency. In practice, considerably less than 100% is co-fired
        in such plants.<br/>\r\nThe sustainability of bio-oil has been in dispute
        for a couple of years now, and its popularity has declined strongly. Future
        international regulation of bio-oil production may mean bio-oil will be used
        more often.  \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nAt the bottom of each page, you can see how
        much arable land you need world-wide to grow all the required biomass.\r\n"

      title: Biocoal
      short_description: ''
      description: 'Bio-coal is a fuel with properties sufficiently similar to coal
        that it be used as a substitute. It is made by torrefaction of woody biomass.
        Torrefaction of biomass occurs at temperatures of several hundred &#8451;
        in the absence of oxygen.  '

      short_description: ''
      description: Coal is the most CO<sub>2</sub> intensive of all fossil fuels.
        For that reason, governments promote and subsidize replacing a part of coal
        for electricity production by biomass alternatives.

      short_description: ''
      description: "Gas-fired power plants obtain their gas from the gas mains, of
        course. Some of this gas may be green gas, if you have set this to be the
        case. \r\n<br/>\r\nAlternatively, gas-fired plants can co-fire oil and bio-oil."

      short_description: ''
      description: This slider sets what percentage of the total input consists of
        oil-derivatives that are 'co-fired' in industrial CHPs. The oil is injected
        into the furnace as a fine mist together with the gas. In theory, it is possible
        to substitute 100% of the gas in this way without losing efficiency. In practice
        less than the theoretical maximum is co-fired in such plants.

      title: Wet biomass
      short_description:
      description: 'Wet biomass is biomass with a moisture percentage of at least
        40-50%. This includes: residues from the food and beverage industry, agricultural
        residual streams, sewage sludge, aquatic biomass, cultivated grain products,
        etc.'
    max_demand_of_dry_biomass:
      title: Dry biomass
      short_description:
      description: 'Dry biomass consists of relatively dry organic material, like
        wood. Dry biomass is ''simple biomass'': it requires no processing and provides
        a high return. There is therefore a great demand for clean, woody biomass.
        Examples of woody biomass are residual streams from forestry (tree tops, stumps,
        bark, branches), recycled waste wood, residual streams from agriculture (straw),
        and fast-growing bio-energy crops (elephant grass, willow, poplar).'
    max_demand_of_oily_biomass:
      title: Oil-containing biomass
      short_description:
      description: 'Oil-containing biomass is biomass with seeds that contain oil.
        Crude biodiesel is produced by pressing oil seeds. This can be converted into
        biodiesel in an esterification process with the addition of methanol. Examples
        of oil-containing biomass are: rapeseed, sunflower seeds, oil palm. Used frying
        fats also fall within this category.'

      title: Anaerobic digestion
      short_description:
      description: "Currently green gas is mostly generated from the anaerobic digestion
        of organic biomass and residues produced in agriculture, food production and
        waste processing. There are two methods for biomass digestion: mono-digestion
        (one residual flow) or co-digestion (multiple flows with at least 50% animal
        manure). After digestion the produced biogas can be either used directly for
        power and/or heat generation or can be converted into green gas to make it
        suitable for the gas network.\r\n</br></br>\r\nThe ETM models one general
        type of digester that digests wet biomass. The specifications of this technology
        can be found below."

      title: Dry biomass gasification
      short_description:
      description: During dry gasification dry biomass is gasified at high temperatures
        (800 to 1000 °C), a kind of combustion with a lack of oxygen. The formation
        of a synthesis gas is central to gasification. This synthesis gas is a flammable
        mixture of methane, hydrogen, CO<sub>2</sub> en CO. The gasification route
        offers flexibility when it comes to the possible follow-up routes and end
        products to be manufactured (green gas, hydrogen, transport biofuels and more).
        In the case of green gas production, gasification is followed by methane synthesis,
        and reprocessing into green gas of natural gas quality.

      title: Wet biomass gasification (SCW)
      short_description:
      description: Wet gasification is also called Super Critical Water gasification
        (SCW). During SCW wet biomass is converted into green gas under high pressure
        and temperature (at least 375 °C and 221 bar). Above this critical point,
        water achieves supercritical conditions. During this phase all organic molecules
        within the biomass fall apart en reach a new balance in the form of synthesis
        gas (methane, hydrogen, CO<sub>2</sub> and CO) (Gasunie, 2019). Inorganic
        substances crystallize out simultaneously so that they can be recovered.
