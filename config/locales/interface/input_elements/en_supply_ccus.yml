      title: Steel industry
      description: |
        What share of capturable CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the steel industry will be captured in
        your scenario? The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be captured depends on the size of the
        steel industry and the chosen steel production technology in your scenario. You can change
        this in <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/steel">the Demand → Industry → Steel section</a>.

        The ETM calculates the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> capture on total emissions, energy use and
        costs.<br/><br/> In the link below, the specs for blastfurnace capture are displayed.
    share_of_industry_chemicals_fertilizers_captured_processes_co2:
      title: Fertilizer industry (process)
      description: |
        What share of capturable process emissions in the fertilizers industry will be captured in
        your scenario? The steam methane reforming process yields high purity CO<sub>2</sub> streams
        that are relatively simple to capture. The costs and energy use of capture are low compared
        to capture of combustion emissions.<br/><br/> The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be
        captured depends on the size of the fertilizers industry in your scenario and whether
        hydrogen is produced 'on-site' or imported directly. You can change this in
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers">the Demand → Industry → Fertlilizers section</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        The ETM calculates the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> capture on total emissions, energy use and
        costs.
        <br/><br/>
        In some areas, CO<sub>2</sub> capture of process emissions already takes place today. The
        captured CO<sub>2</sub> is for example used for the production of urea or supplied to the
        food industry for the production of soft drinks and beer.

    share_of_industry_chemicals_fertilizers_captured_combustion_co2:
      title: Fertilizer industry (combustion)
      description: |
        What share of capturable combustion emissions in the fertilizers industry will be captured
        in your scenario? Capture of combustion emissions is relatively expensive and energy
        intensive because the CO<sub>2</sub> has to be separated from other molecules found in the
        flue gas.<br/><br/> The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can be captured depends on the size
        and efficiency of the fertilizers industry in your scenario. You can change this in
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers">the Demand → Industry → Fertlilizers section</a>.

      title: Pulverised coal
      description: |
        What share of installed pulverised coal capacity will be equipped with a CO<sub>2</sub>
        capture unit? How much CO<sub>2</sub> is captured depends on the number of full load hours
        of these power plants in your scenario. This is influenced by electricity demand, other
        installed power generation technologies and commodity prices.<br/><br/> The amount of

      description: |
        What share of installed biomass gasification capacity for hydrogen production will be
        equipped with a CO<sub>2</sub> capture unit? Because biomass emissions are considered to be
        'short cycle' emissions, capturing these emissions could lead to so-called 'negative'
        emissions. You can find more information on this in the

    demand_of_molecules_direct_air_capture_co2:
      title: Direct Air Capture (DAC)
      description: |
        This slider sets the installed capacity of Direct Air Capture plants. Direct Air Capture is
        a process of capturing CO<sub>2</sub> directly from the ambient air using electricity. If
        the electricity used is renewable, storing the captured CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to a net
        decrease in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels ('negative emissions'). The captured
        CO<sub>2</sub> can also be used for the production of carbon neutral fuels.<br/><br/> You
        can explore these options in
        <a href="/scenario/supply/ccus/utilisation-and-storage-of-co2">the Supply → CCUS → Utilisation and Storage section</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        Direct Air Capture is a promising technology to bring down global CO<sub>2</sub> levels in
        the atmosphere. However, it is also an energy intensive and (at this moment) expensive process.
        Since CO<sub>2</sub> in the
        ambient air is 'available' everywhere in the world, DAC capacity is likely to be installed
        in areas that will have very low (renewable) power costs.
    demand_of_molecules_offshore_sequestration_co2:
      title: Offshore storage
      description: |
        This slider sets the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> <i>per year</i> that is used for long-term storage offshore.
        For example saline acquifers and aging oil or gas fields can be used for this
        purpose.
        <br/><br/>
        The ETM calculates the impact of CO<sub>2</sub> storage on total
        emissions, energy use and costs.
        <br /><br />
        The maximum of this slider varies per region in the ETM and is based on public research.
        It is assumed that the maximum storage value per year can be sustained for a period of 40 years.
        For example, research for the Netherlands indicates that a total of 1680 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> can
        be stored offshore. This comes down to 42 Mt (the slider max) per year over a period of 40 years.<br/>
        Please note: For some regions, no data could be found on storage potentials. An overview of the
        research used can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/blob/master/source_analyses/eu/2015/11_area/11_ccs_offshore_storage_potential_per_year.xls">
        ETDataset</a><br/>.
    output_of_energy_production_synthetic_kerosene:
      title: Synthetic kerosene
      description: |
        This slider set the amount of synthetic kerosene produced in your scenario. Synthetic
        kerosene is made from captured CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen and electricity. If renewable
        electricity, green hydrogen and green CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. Direct Air Capture) is used in
        this process, it is possible to produce carbon neutral fuels for (e.g.) aviation.
        <br/><br/>
        If you would like to know the total demand and supply of kerosene in your
        scenario, have a look at the
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="mekko_of_kerosene_demand_supply">demand and supply of kerosene</a>
        chart. Any excess production is automatically exported, any deficit is imported.
        <br/><br/>
        Energy demand of international aviation is not taken into account in the ETM by default.
        You can change this assumption
        in the <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-transport">
        the Demand → Transport → International transport section</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        Please note: This slider does not automatically reduce the production of fossil-based
        kerosene in the refineries sector. If you would like to replace fossil kerosene with
        synthetic kerosene in your scenario, you can reduce the market share of refineries in
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/refineries">the Demand → Industry → Refineries section</a>.
    output_of_energy_production_synthetic_methanol:
      title: Synthetic methanol
      description: |
        Methanol is one of the most widely used chemicals in the chemical industry sector. For
        example, it is used for the production of plastics and polyester. In addition, methanol can
        be used as a fuel. Currently, methanol is mainly produced using natural gas. However, it is
        possible to make synthetic methanol using CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen and electricity. If
        renewable electricity, green hydrogen and green CO<sub>2</sub> (e.g. Direct Air Capture) is
        used, this production process can be fully carbon neutral.
        <br/><br/>
        This slider allows you to set the amount of synthetic methanol produced in your scenario,
        but does not affect the production of methanol and other chemical products in the
        conventional chemical industry sector. You can change this in
        <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/chemicals">the Demand → Industry → Chemicals section</a>.
    demand_of_molecules_other_utilisation_co2:
      title: Other use of CO<sub>2</sub>
      description: |
        This slider sets the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>  used for 'other' purposes. This encompasses
        all utilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> that is not modelled separately in the ETM. Examples
        include utilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> as a propellant gas for beer and soda or for the
        cultivation of crops in greenhouses. CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the fertilizers industry
        sector can also be captured and used to produce urea, which is used as an animal feed
        additive and fertilizer.
        <br/><br/>
        In many cases, utilising CO<sub>2</sub> does not reduce emission but only delays it.
        Therefore, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> set with this slider is included in the total
        emissions of your scenario.
