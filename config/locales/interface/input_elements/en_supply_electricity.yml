        Like wind power, solar power output fluctuates over
        time, but in a more predictable way, making it easier to keep the electricity
        grid in balance. Still, the impact of installing large numbers of solar panels
        can be large, because electricity is fed back into the local grid. This may

        This builds a 50 MWe concentrated solar power (CSP) plant with heat storage. Such a plant is
        very attractive in sunny desert-like areas, but less so in Northern Europe. It needs direct
        sunlight, which is concentrated by concave mirrors to produce heat and generate electricity.
        <br/><br/>
        This type of plant stores the heat, allowing it to keep on producing electricity until
        several hours after sundown.
    capacity_of_energy_battery_solar_pv_solar_radiation:
      title: Solar on land (with battery system)
      short_description:
      description: |
        Different from regular solar PV plants, these plants are fitted with a battery and
        a reduced grid connection capacity by default, as an integrated system. These plants are typically
        large-scale, defined as having an output capacity of > 15 kWp within the Netherlands and
        > 20 kWp for all other European countries. <br/><br/>
        Due to the volatile nature of solar power output, installing large numbers of solar
        panels can have a major impact on the electricity grid. To prevent large capacity
        peaks on the grid, these plants are not connected to the grid for the entire installed
        capacity, but by a reduced amount. When production exceeds the grid connection capacity
        the battery consumes electricity. When the production drops below the threshold, the
        battery starts to release the electricity again. Note that due to efficiency losses and
        storage decay, some electricity is lost in the process. <br/><br/>
        If the battery cannot consume any more electricity due to charging
        capacity or volume constraints, the excess electricity production will be curtailed. <br/><br/>
        Both the grid connection capacity and the input capacity of the battery are defined
        relative to the installed capacity. They will therefore both change accordingly if
        you adjust this slider. You can also change the relative ratios in the Flexibility
        section, under
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/solar-on-land-with-battery-system">

      title: Solar offshore
      short_description:
      description: |
        With this slider you can build centralized plants of photovoltaic solar power panels.
        This type osf of solar PV plants is built to float in the sea. These plants are typically
        large-scale, defined as having an output capacity of > 15 kWp within the Netherlands and
        > 20 kWp for all other European countries. </br></br>
        This technology is developed to increase the potential installation area for solar
        PV plants in a country. Additionally, these plants might be placed between offshore wind turbines,
        taking up no extra offshore surface. The idea is that the hourly production profiles of solar and wind can
        complement each other, meaning that the power cable to land will be better utilized.
        You can see the combined output of offshore solar PV plants and wind parks in
        <a
          href="#"

          data-chart-location="side">
          this chart</a>. </br></br>
        Production by solar can be more volatile than wind. To further enhance the compatibility
        of offshore solar and wind, the grid connection of these solar PV plants is
        therefore reduced by default with 33% of the peak capacity. You can change this value

      short_description: ''
      description: |
        Different from regular wind turbines on land, these turbines are fitted with a battery and
        a reduced grid connection capacity by default, as an integrated system. <br/><br/>
        Due to the volatile nature of wind power output, installing large numbers of wind
        turbines can have a major impact on the electricity grid. To prevent large capacity
        peaks on the grid, these turbines are not connected to the grid for the entire installed
        capacity, but by a reduced amount. When production exceeds the grid connection capacity
        the battery consumes electricity. When the production drops below the threshold, the
        battery starts to release the electricity again. Note that due to efficiency losses and
        storage decay, some electricity is lost in the process. <br/><br/>
        If the battery cannot consume any more electricity due to charging
        capacity or volume constraints, the excess electricity production will be curtailed. <br/><br/>
        Both the grid connection capacity and the input capacity of the battery are defined
        relative to the installed capacity. They will therefore both change accordingly if
        you adjust this slider. You can also change the relative ratios in the Flexibility
