    capacity_of_energy_battery_solar_pv_solar_radiation:
      title: Solar PV plants onshore with battery system
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        Different from regular solar PV plants, these plants are fitted with a battery and
        a reduced grid connection capacity by default, as an integrated system. These plants are typically
        large-scale, defined as having an output capacity of > 15 kWp within the Netherlands and
        > 20 kWp for all other European countries. <br/><br/>
        Due to the volatile nature of solar power output, installing large numbers of solar
        panels can have a major impact on the electricity grid. To prevent large capacity
        peaks on the grid, these plants are not connected to the grid for the entire installed
        capacity, but by a reduced amount. When production exceeds the grid connection capacity
        the battery consumes electricity. When the production drops below the threshold, the
        battery starts to release the electricity again. Note that due to efficiency losses and
        storage decay, some electricity is lost in the process. <br/><br/>
        If the battery cannot consume any more electricity due to charging
        capacity or volume constraints, the excess electricity production will be curtailed. <br/><br/>
        Both the grid connection capacity and the input capacity of the battery are defined
        relative to the installed capacity. They will therefore both change accordingly if
        you adjust this slider. You can also change the relative ratios in the Flexibility

        With this slider you can build centralized plants of photovoltaic solar power panels.
        This type osf of solar PV plants is built to float in the sea. These plants are typically
        large-scale, defined as having an output capacity of > 15 kWp within the Netherlands and
        > 20 kWp for all other European countries. </br></br>
        This technology is developed to increase the potential installation area for solar
        PV plants in a country. Additionally, these plants might be placed between offshore wind turbines,
        taking up no extra offshore surface. The idea is that the hourly production profiles of solar and wind can
        complement each other, meaning that the power cable to land will be better utilized.
        You can see the combined output of offshore solar PV plants and wind parks in
        <a

        Production by solar can be more volatile than wind. To further enhance the compatibility
        of offshore solar and wind, the grid connection of these solar PV plants is
        therefore reduced by default with 33% of the peak capacity. You can change this value

      description: |
        Different from regular wind turbines on land, these turbines are fitted with a battery and
        a reduced grid connection capacity by default, as an integrated system. <br/><br/>
        Due to the volatile nature of wind power output, installing large numbers of wind
        turbines can have a major impact on the electricity grid. To prevent large capacity
        peaks on the grid, these turbines are not connected to the grid for the entire installed
        capacity, but by a reduced amount. When production exceeds the grid connection capacity
        the battery consumes electricity. When the production drops below the threshold, the
        battery starts to release the electricity again. Note that due to efficiency losses and
        storage decay, some electricity is lost in the process. <br/><br/>
        If the battery cannot consume any more electricity due to charging
        capacity or volume constraints, the excess electricity production will be curtailed. <br/><br/>
        Both the grid connection capacity and the input capacity of the battery are defined

        power production in scenarios that have a lot of installed wind and solar

        plants. Most important are their flexibility and the speed at which they can
        vary their power output. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nEach unit can operate at any load
        between <1% and 100% without loss of output efficiency. Each unit can also

        <em>without any loss of efficiency</em>. This makes it possible to balance
        large fluctuations in wind power production and maintain grid stability. Power
        plants with a steam cycle or even gas turbines often lose tens of percents
