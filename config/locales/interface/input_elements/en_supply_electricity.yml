        A biomass power plant produces electricity from biomass feedstock.
        For a typical biomass power plant, a share of its installed capacity operates on a must-run basis,
        ensuring continuous electricity production regardless of demand fluctuations. The remaining capacity is
        dispatchable, meaning it operates flexibly to meet varying electricity demand. Therefore, logically
        there will be no installed dispatchable capacity if there is no installed must-run capacity for the

        In a coal gasification power plant, coal is converted into syngas, which is then combusted.
        This technology is more efficient and cleaner than pulverized coal power plants, but is
        still in an early commercial stage. Although coal-fired power plants often operate
