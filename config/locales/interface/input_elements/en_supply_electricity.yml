        that they can handle being turned on and off within minutes. \r\nThese turbines
        are therefore most often used to provide power during demand peaks. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAlthough
        the number of operating hours per year and total electricity production of
        these plants are quite limited, they are extremely useful to have in your

      short_description:
      description: "This is a power plant made up of 22 reciprocating combustion engine
        units (18 MWe each), which makes for a 400 MWe power plant. The engines are
        flexible in terms of what fuel they can use, but in the ETM they are gas-fired.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAlthough
        marginal costs are a bit high for these plants, their total costs are quite
        low compared to other gas-fired plants, making them an attractive back up
        option in high wind and solar scenarios.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThese power plants
        are sometimes touted as an excellent solution to the problem of highly variable
        power production in scenarios that have a lot of installed wind and solar
        power. Reciprocating engines offer several advantages over traditional power
        plants. Most important are their flexibility and the speed at which they can
        vary their power output. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nEach unit can operate at any load
        between <1% and 100% without loss of output efficiency. Each unit can also
        increase its output from 0 to 100% in ~2 minutes, and start delivering power
        to the grid within 30 seconds of being started, regardless of its off time.
        Since each <em>plant</em> contains 22 units, the plant can provide anywhere
        between ~1 MWe and 400 MWe of power to the grid within minutes at most, shut
        down completely within 1 minute and be back at full power 2 minutes later
        <em>without any loss of efficiency</em>. This makes it possible to balance
        large fluctuations in wind power production and maintain grid stability. Power
        plants with a steam cycle or even gas turbines often lose tens of percents
        in efficiency when their load drops to below 60 - 70%, making them much less
        efficient in balancing wind power. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe input of the slider
        (in MW) is converted to a (partial) number of the plant described above."

        Green gas is conventionally produced by bacteria that digest biological material
        with an upgrading step to natural gas quality. In the future green gas can
        also be produced through gasification, which can be chosen in <a href="/scenario/supply/biomass/green-gas-production">green
