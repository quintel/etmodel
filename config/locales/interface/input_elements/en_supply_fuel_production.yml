        This slider sets the annual useful production of oil refineries.<br/><br/>
        The input of the transformation process of oil refineries consists of <b>crude oil</b>.
        The following output products can be produced from oil refineries:
        <ul>
        <li><b>diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>gasoline</b></li>
        <li><b>liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)</b></li>
        <li><b>kerosene</b></li>
        <li><b>heavy fuel oil (HFO)</b></li>
        <li><b>naphtha</b></li>
        <li><b>other oil products</b></li>
        <li><b>refinery gas</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        If there is no oil refinery in the scenario in the start year (since there are no oil
        refineries present in the selected region), the output fractions of refinery output products
        are determined based on a refinery archetype.<br/><br/>
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/oil-refineries">oil refineries</a>
        section to make assumptions in efficiency improvements and in technologies used for heat
        production in oil refineries.

      title: Fischer-Tropsch
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from Fischer-Tropsch.
        The process of Fischer-Tropsch converts syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) into liquid hydrocarbons.<br/><br/>
        The following feedstock (routes) can be used for syngas production for Fischer-Tropsch, and therefore
        represent feedstock going into this process:
        <ul>
        <li><b>hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub></b></li>
        <li><b>non-biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>dry biomass</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The output of Fischer-Tropsch consists of the following fuels and feedstock:
        <ul>
        <li><b>kerosene</b> (main product)</li>
        <li><b>diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>naphtha</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        Depending on the type of feedstock going into the process, the produced products from Fischer-Tropsch will
        differ in the extent to which they are synthetic, biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/fischer-tropsch">Fischer-Tropsch</a> section to set
        the shares the feedstock routes that produce syngas for Fischer-Tropsch.

      title: Methanol synthesis
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of methanol from methanol synthesis.
        In this process, syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) is converted to methanol.<br/><br/>
        The following feedstock (routes) can be used for syngas production for methanol synthesis, and therefore
        represent feedstock going into this process:
        <ul>
        <li><b>hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub></b></li>
        <li><b>non-biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>dry biomass</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The only output product is <b>methanol</b>. Depending on the type of used feedstock, the produced methanol
        will differ in the extent to which it is synthetic, biogenic or non-biogenic.<br/><br/>
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/methanol-synthesis">Methanol synthesis</a> section
        the shares of the different feedstock routes for syngas production for methanol synthesis can be set.
    output_of_energy_production_fractionation_pyrolysis_oil:
      title: Pyrolysis oil fractionation
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from fractionation of
        pyrolysis oil (non-biogenic). In this process, pyrolysis oil is upgraded through hydrotreatment.<br/><br/>
        The pyrolysis oil, required for fractionation, can be produced through fast pyrolysis of feedstock.
        Pyrolysis oil (non-biogenic) can only be produced with <b>non-biogenic waste</b>. Furthermore, there is
        input of <b>hydrogen</b> in the hydrotreatment process of fractionation of pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        The following fuels can be produced from pyrolysis oil fractionation:
        <ul>
        <li><b>diesel</b></li>
        <li><b>gasoline</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The model assumes that required pyrolysis oil for the fractionation process or for baseload export is produced locally. This can be altered by
        setting import of pyrolysis oil, which will substitute the local production of pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        Go to the section
        <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/pyrolysis-oil-fractionation">Pyrolysis oil fractionation</a> to set the import
        of pyrolysis oil.

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of liquid fuels and feedstock from fractionation of biogenic
        pyrolysis oil (further referred to as pyrolysis bio-oil). In this process, pyrolysis bio-oil is upgraded through hydrotreatment.<br/><br/>
        The pyrolysis bio-oil, required for fractionation, can be produced through fast pyrolysis of feedstock.
        Pyrolysis bio-oil can be produced with the following feedstock:
        <ul>
        <li><b>biogenic waste</b></li>
        <li><b>dry biomass</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        Furthermore, input of <b>hydrogen</b> is required in the hydrotreatment process of fractionation of pyrolysis bio-oil.<br/><br/>
        The following fuels can be produced from pyrolysis bio-oil fractionation:
        <ul>
        <li><b>biodiesel</b></li>
        <li><b>bioethanol</b>*</li>
        </ul><br/>
        <i>* The actual output product should be biogasoline. However, the carrier biogasoline is
        as of yet not modelled in the ETM. Instead, the ETM models final demand for
        biogasoline (from national energy balances) as bioethanol. Therefore, output of biogasoline
        from this process is assumed to be bioethanol.</i><br/><br/>
        The model assumes that required pyrolysis bio-oil for the fractionation process or for baseload export is produced locally. This can be altered by
        setting import of pyrolysis bio-oil, which will substitute the local production of pyrolysis oil.<br/><br/>
        Go to the section
        <a href="/scenario/supply/fuel_production/pyrolysis-oil-fractionation">Pyrolysis oil fractionation</a> to set the import
        of pyrolysis bio-oil and to set the shares of feedstock used for pyrolysis bio-oil production.

      title: Hydrotreatment to HVO (biokerosene)
      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) biokerosene
        from hydrotreatment of oily biomass, such as vegetable oils and animal fats.<br/><br/>
        The process of producing HVO biokerosene and HVO biodiesel is very similar. The main difference is that an extra
        processing step of cracking is required for HVO biokerosene to obtain lighter fractions suitable for aviation fuel.<br/><br/>
        The carrier input for this process consists of:
        <ul>
        <li><b>oily biomass</b></li>
        <li><b>hydrogen</b></li>
        <li><b>network gas</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The output products of hydrotreatment to HVO biokerosene are:

        <li><b>biokerosene</b> (main product)</li>
        <li><b>bionaphtha</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        <b>Note:</b> other, smaller fractions of output products can also be produced in this process,
        but are not modelled in the ETM. The output fractions of biokerosene and bionaphtha are
        increased proportionally to account for not modelled useful fuel output.
        See the technical specs below for more information.

      short_description:
      description: |
        This slider sets the annual useful production of bio-ethanol from fermentation of wet
        biomass, such as agricultural residues and cultivated grain products.<br/><br/>
        In this process, bio-ethanol is produced by hydrolysing carbohydrates in wet biomass to sugars, subsequently
        using yeast or bacteria to convert these sugars into ethanol.<br/><br/>
        The carrier input of this process consists of:
        <ul>
        <li><b>wet biomass</b></li>
        <li><b>network gas</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        The output product is <b>bio-ethanol</b>. Note that this process has output of
        distillers' dried grains (DDG), which is not modelled in the ETM and is assumed to have
        no relevant energy purpose. This is therefore considered as loss.

        used to produce the syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) required for the
        Fischer-Tropsch process.<br/><br/>
        The output of Fischer-Tropsch with the hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub> route consists

        </ul><br/>
        <b>Note:</b> in the other feedstock routes for Fischer-Tropsch, diesel is also an
        output product. In this feedstock route, an output of diesel causes circularity in the
        modelling, which cannot be calculated by the
        model so far. Therefore, this feedstock route does not have an output of diesel. Instead,
        the output fractions of kerosene and naphtha are proporionally increased.<br/><br/>

    capacity_of_energy_production_fischer_tropsch_synthetic_dispatchable:
      title: Fischer-Tropsch (with hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>)
      description: |
        This slider sets the installed dispatchable capacity (in electricity input capacity)
        of Fischer-Tropsch with the synthetic route, using hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub>.
        These feedstocks are used to produce the syngas (a mixture of mainly CO and hydrogen) required for the
        Fischer-Tropsch process.<br/><br/>
        The output of Fischer-Tropsch with the hydrogen, electricity and CO<sub>2</sub> route consists
        of the following fuels and feedstock:
        <ul>
        <li><b>kerosene</b> (main product)</li>
        <li><b>naphtha</b></li>
        </ul><br/>
        <b>Note:</b> in the other feedstock routes for Fischer-Tropsch, diesel is also an
        output product. In this feedstock route, an output of diesel causes circularity in the
        modelling, which cannot be calculated by the
        model so far. Therefore, this feedstock route does not have an output of diesel. Instead,
        the output fractions of kerosene and naphtha are proporionally increased.<br/><br/>
        The flexible production from Fischer-Tropsch is electricity price-driven and is therefore
        considered as flexible electricity demand technology. The technology will produce when the
        electricity price is lower than the willingness to pay.<br/><br/>
        Go to the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-fuels">
        Flexibility</a> section to set the willingness to pay of this technology.
        Consult the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand"
        target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for more information on flexible electricity demand technologies.<br/><br/>
