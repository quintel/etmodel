        It typically supplies several customers and is runs 8000 hours a year, of
        which 6000 hours to supply heat as steam. <br/><br/>

        This gas turbine CHP is typically found at a medium-sized industrial
        firm to deliver power and steam. Several units are sometimes found on one
        site in order to deliver steam to neighboring firms. <br/><br/>
        Firms in the petro-chemical industry often work round the clock. so full load hours
        for electricity are up to 8000 hours a year. Steam delivery may vary, for
        example as a result of seasonal differences, meaning full load hours for heat
        are lower at 6000 hours per year. <br/><br/>

      short_description:
      description: 'Here you can specify the heat output capacity per hour of heat storage.
        By default, this capacity is unlimited, meaning that there is no limit to the amount
        of heat that can be drawn from heat storage in one hour (given that enough heat is
        available in the storage). With this slider you can limit this. This can result
        in a slower depletion of heat storage. A consequence of this could be that other
        dispatchable heat sources (such as gas heaters) need to be switched on earlier.<br/><br/>
        The slider is a percentage of the average heat demand per hour. E.g. a slider value of
        200% means that, in a given hour, up to 2 times the average heat demand per hour can
        be drawn from the storage. To see the resulting capacity in MW, please open the chart

      short_description:
      description: The default value for the distribution losses slider is typically
        low or even zero for many regions modelled in the ETM. This is mainly due
        to a lack of reliable data for the present year. Please make sure to change
        this slider to a more realistic value if district heating plays a role in
        your scenario. A 15% loss value is a sensible default for new district heating
        systems. For older systems, this is closer to 25-30%.
