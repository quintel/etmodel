      short_description: 
      description: The default value for the distribution losses slider is typically

        to a lack of reliable data for the present year. Please make sure to change
        this slider to a more realistic value if district heating plays a role in
        your scenario. A 15% loss value is a sensible default for new district heating
        systems. For older systems, this is closer to 25-30%.
