        that generate both heat and electricity. The combination of heat and electricity
        makes this option quite energy efficient. Also, locally producing and using
        heat and electricity reduces transportation losses and saves energy. CHPs

        factories for example. <br/><br/>
        This plant combines a gas turbine
        with a steam turbine and is located on a typical large-sized industrial park.
        It typically supplies several customers and is runs 8000 hours a year, of
        which 6000 hours to supply heat as steam. <br/><br/>

        Firms in the petro-chemical industry often work round the clock. so full load hours
        for electricity are up to 8000 hours a year. Steam delivery may vary, for
        example as a result of seasonal differences, meaning full load hours for heat
        are lower at 6000 hours per year. <br/><br/>

      title: Supply and potential of residual heat
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart compares the supply and potential of residual heat.
        You can set the supply of residual heat for each temperature level
        in the <a href="scenario/supply/heat/overview-district-heating"> District heating</a> section.
        The residual heat potential is calculated based on the size of the following sectors: 
        <ul>
        <li><a href="scenario/demand/industry/refineries">Refineries</a> </li>
        <li><a href="/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers">Fertilizer production</a> </li>
        <li><a href="/scenario/demand/industry/chemicals">Chemicals</a> </li>
        <li><a href="/scenario/demand/industry/central-ict">Central ICT</a> </li>
        <li><a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-hydrogen">Conversion to hydrogen via power-to-gas</a></li>
        </ul>
        Note that although you can set the supply of residual heat manually above the potentials shown, 
        in reality the heat needs to be provided by some industry or another.
