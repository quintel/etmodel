      title: Steam methane reforming + CCS
      short_description:
      description: "Steam methane reforming is a very mature hydrogen production process.
        It works like this: methane reacts in the presence of a catalyst with high
        temperature steam and gives a mixture of hydrogen and other gases. The unwanted
        gases (including CO<sub>2</sub>) are then separated through further reactions
        and the resulting hydrogen is purified to meet industrial standards. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSteam
        methane reforming is already widely employed, but mostly for industry use.
        This plant's input is network gas, so by changing the network gas composition
        <a href=\"/scenario/supply/other_fuels/gas-from-gas-network\" >here</a>, you
        can change how green the hydrogen you produce is. Steam methane reforming
        is often thought of an important transitional hydrogen production process:
        far from the cleanest and greenest, but able to facilitate upcoming hydrogen
        demand.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nTo reduce its CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions, this plant
        has received a CCS (CO<sub>2</sub> Capture and Storage) extension. In short,
        this means that carbon dioxide is separated, captured and then stored in nearby
        depleted gas or oil fields, or geological formations like salt caverns. This
        of course requires higher investments and maintenance costs, but in return
        significantly cuts GHG emissions.<br/>"

      title: Local electrolysis
      short_description:
      description: "Electrolysis is a hydrogen production process known for many,
        many years. Put simply, by adding to electrodes and applying a current to
        a container filled with water, water molecules are forced to split into hydrogen
        and oxygen. This is an energy intensive process, since current does not travel
        through water easily. Water is made more conductive by using an electrolyte,
        i.e. a substance that when dissolved has a charge and conducts electricity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        various main types of electrolysis differ in electrolyte, temperature and
        pressure of operation. This is a small local electrolysis plant of 0.5MW installed
        at a retail station that produces hydrogen through alkaline electrolysis (based
        on the Hamburg Vattenfall station). Larger, central electrolysis units exist,
        but as of now have only slightly higher efficiencies.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        most promising technique with a significantly higher efficiency, nowadays
        still in R&D phase and coping with a short lifetime and limited capacity,
        is high temperature solid oxide electrolysis. Generally expected to be commercially
        available between 2020 and 2025, it would be a large scale highly efficient
        process that, especially when coupled with renewably produced electricity,
        can be a major leap in greening our fuels."

      short_description:
      description: "How many wind turbines will produce electricity that will directly

        a number of plans for building wind parks far out on sea. For these parks
        it will probably be economically more viable to convert the electricity directly
        into hydrogen instead of transporting the electricity to land first. This
        has to do with the high electricity cabling costs relative to the low gas
        piping costs. \r\n</br></br>\r\nThis slider sets the installed capacity of

      description: "How much hydrogen will be imported in the future?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis
        slider sets the amount of hydrogen that is imported from outside your area.
        The hydrogen can originate from different countries and can be produced with
        different technologies, which both influence the accompanied CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions.
        Therefore, it is possible to adjust the CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of imported
        hydrogen in the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/co-sub-2-sub-emissions-of-imported-hydrogen\"

      short_description:
      description: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your
        scenario is transported via trucks? Truck transport is flexible and can be
        scaled up or down relatively easily. As such, it is a suitable option when
        hydrogen demand is more dispersed and when volumes are lower. This may for
        example be the case for hydrogen delivery to refuelling stations.

      short_description:
      description: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your
        scenario is transported via pipelines? Pipeline transport can be relatively
        cheap but requires large investments up-front. As such, this option seems
        to be the most viable when hydrogen demand is concentrated and hydrogen volumes
        are large. This may for example be the case if large industrial sites switch
        to hydrogen. In the future it may be possible to repurpose (parts of) the
        existing gas networks, which can reduce investment costs.
