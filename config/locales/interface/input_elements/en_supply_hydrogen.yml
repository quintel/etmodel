    capacity_of_energy_hydrogen_steam_methane_reformer:
      title: Steam methane reforming
      short_description:
      description: "Steam methane reforming is a very mature hydrogen production process.
        It works like this: methane reacts in the presence of a catalyst with high
        temperature steam and gives a mixture of hydrogen and other gases. The unwanted
        gases (including CO<sub>2</sub>) are then separated through further reactions
        and the resulting hydrogen is purified to meet industrial standards. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSteam
        methane reforming is already widely employed, but mostly for industry use.
        This plant's input is natural gas. Steam methane reforming
        is often thought of an important transitional hydrogen production process:
        far from the cleanest and greenest, but able to facilitate upcoming hydrogen
        demand.<br />"

        be converted into hydrogen with electrolysers?\r\n</br></br>\r\nThere are
        a number of plans for building wind parks far out on sea. For these parks
        it will probably be economically more viable to convert the electricity directly
        into hydrogen instead of transporting the electricity to land first. This
        has to do with the high electricity cabling costs relative to the low gas
        piping costs. \r\n</br></br>\r\nThis slider sets the installed capacity of
        offshore wind turbines dedicated to hydrogen production and a corresponding
        amount of electrolysis capacity to convert the produced electricity into hydrogen.

      short_description:
      description: "How much hydrogen will be imported in the future?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis
        slider sets the amount of hydrogen that is imported from outside your area.
        The hydrogen can originate from different countries and can be produced with
        different technologies, which both influence the accompanied CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        Therefore, it is possible to adjust the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of imported
        hydrogen in the <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/co-sub-2-sub-emissions-of-imported-hydrogen\"

      title: Compressed H<sub>2</sub> in trucks
      short_description:
      description: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your
        scenario is transported via trucks? Truck transport is flexible and can be
        scaled up or down relatively easily. As such, it is a suitable option when
        hydrogen demand is more dispersed and when volumes are lower. This may for
        example be the case for hydrogen delivery to refuelling stations.

      title: H<sub>2</sub> pipelines
      short_description:
      description: What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your
        scenario is transported via pipelines? Pipeline transport can be relatively
        cheap but requires large investments up-front. As such, this option seems
        to be the most viable when hydrogen demand is concentrated and hydrogen volumes
        are large. This may for example be the case if large industrial sites switch
        to hydrogen. In the future it may be possible to repurpose (parts of) the
        existing gas networks, which can reduce investment costs.
