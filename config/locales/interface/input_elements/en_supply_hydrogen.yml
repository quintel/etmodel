      title: Steam methane reforming
      short_description:
      description: | 
        Steam methane reforming is a very mature hydrogen production process.
        It works like this: methane reacts in the presence of a catalyst with high
        temperature steam and gives a mixture of hydrogen and other gases. The unwanted
        gases (including CO<sub>2</sub>) are then separated through further reactions
        and the resulting hydrogen is purified to meet industrial standards. <br/><br/>Steam
        methane reforming is already widely employed, but mostly for industry use.
        This plant's input is natural gas. Steam methane reforming
        is often thought of an important transitional hydrogen production process:
        far from the cleanest and greenest, but able to facilitate upcoming hydrogen
        demand.
        <br/><br/>
        Add CCS to the SMR by going to the <a href="/scenario/emissions/ccus/capture-of-co2">Capture of CO2</a> section.
        <br/><br/>
        For more technology specifications, checkout the technical and financial properties below.
        Note: the parameters in the table belong to the SMR plants without CCS, so when you have set 100% CCS,
        you will see no installed capacity here.

        Adjust the total installed capacity of autothermal reformers (ATR) using this slider.
        <br/><br/>
        Autothermal reforming (ATR) is a production method for hydrogen. It is similar to steam 
        methane reforming (SMR) but has a lower efficiency. The advantage of the ATR, however, 
        is that is has a simpler production stream with a high concentration of carbon 
        dioxide. This makes it easier to capture a higher percentage of carbon emissions during 
        the conversion process.

        How many wind turbines will produce electricity that will directly
        be converted into hydrogen with electrolysers?</br></br>There are
        ambitions for building wind farms far out on sea. For these farms
        it will probably be economically more viable to convert the electricity directly
        into hydrogen instead of transporting the electricity to land first. This
        has to do with the high electricity cabling costs relative to the low gas
        piping costs. </br></br>This slider sets the installed capacity of
        offshore wind turbines dedicated to hydrogen production and a corresponding
        amount of electrolysis capacity to convert the produced electricity into hydrogen.

      title: Ammonia reforming
      short_description:
      description: |
        Reforming of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to produce hydrogen is a novel technology. The 
        process of reforming itself is already very mature because of the steam methane 
        refomer, which is currently widely used. Even so, technological development is required 
        before reforming of ammonia becomes commercially viable. You can change the efficiency 
        and the investment costs of the ammonia reformer in the 
        <a href="/scenario/costs/costs_hydrogen/hydrogen-production"> costs & efficiencies</a> section. </br></br>
        The ammonia used in the reformer is imported. You can determine the import capacity in

        LOHC (Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier) is a chemical compound that can absorb and release
        hydrogen reversibly. They provide a way to store and transport hydrogen at ambient conditions,
        avoiding some of the challenges associated with storing and transporting gaseous hydrogen.
        LOHC reforming is the process of releasing hydrogen from the compounds. Here you can determine
        the capacity of the reformer.

      short_description:
      description: |
        How much hydrogen will be imported in the future?
        This slider sets the amount of hydrogen that is imported from outside your area.
        The hydrogen can originate from different countries and can be produced with
        different technologies, both of which influence the accompanied CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        Therefore, it is possible to adjust the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of imported
        hydrogen in the <a href="/scenario/emissions/emission_factors/co2-emissions-of-imported-hydrogen-carriers-and-ammmonia">Emissions section</a>. 
        Additionally, it is possible to set the costs of imported
        hydrogen in the <a href="/scenario/costs/costs_hydrogen/hydrogen-import">Costs & efficiencies</a> section.

      short_description:
      description: |
        What percentage of the total central hydrogen production in your
        scenario is distributed via trucks after transportation via pipelines? Truck transport is flexible and can be
        scaled up or down relatively easily. As such, it is a suitable option when
        hydrogen demand is more dispersed and when volumes are lower. This may for
        example be the case for hydrogen delivery to refuelling stations.

        The ammonia can originate from different countries and can be produced with
        different types of hydrogen, both of which influence the associated CO<sub>2</sub>

        If the baseload import is insufficient to cover demand, back-up import is used. 
        If it exceeds demand, the excess is exported.
