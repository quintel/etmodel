        This slider sets the energetic share of fossil diesel in the diesel mix used 
        by road transport. </br></br>
        Diesel has a higher energy content than gasoline, and diesel engines
        tend to be more energy efficient than gasoline engines. Due to emissions of
        fine particulate matter, filters are becoming mandatory in most parts of the
        world.

      short_description:

        This slider sets the energetic share of biodiesel in the diesel mix used 
        by road transport. </br></br>
        Biodiesel can be made from a range of vegetable or animal fats.
        Seed oils are particularly popular. Diesel produced from algae has captured
        people's imagination, since growing crops for biodiesel often still competes
        for space with growing food. So far, it accounts for only a small percentage
        of the total production of bio-diesel. <br/><br/>
        Engines can run on
        bio-diesel without modifications, but the vegetable-based diesels tend to
        be rather corrosive to the engine. <br/><br/>

        This slider sets the energetic share of fossil gasoline in the gasoline mix 
        used by road transport. </br></br>
        Gasoline started out as a refinery waste product. Nowadays it is
        the most common fuel for cars, even though it is neither particularly clean,
        nor very efficient.

        This slider sets the energetic share of bio-ethanol in the gasoline mix 
        used by road transport. </br></br>
        Bio-ethanol is a partial replacement for gasoline. Engines can
        run on bio-ethanol without needing re-tuning if not too much bio-ethanol is
        mixed with gasoline. High percentages of bio-ethanol require minor modifications
        to engines in order to retain efficiency. <br/><br/>

        This slider sets the energetic share of fossil LNG in the LNG mix 
        used by road transport. </br></br>
        Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is a clean burning fossil fuel. Liquefaction
        makes natural gas significantly richer in energy, and therefore interesting
        for long distance transport. Currently the only large scale European liquefaction
        plants are found in Norway and LNG is imported from the Middle East as well. <br/><br/>
        LNG is used by trucks (and not by cars) because of its high energy content and
        its slow evaporation process (since it is cooled passively). As the annual
        mileage of trucks is significantly higher and their usage much more constant
        and almost continuous, the high energy content allows for a large driving
        range while LNG evaporation does not pose a problem.

        Bio LNG is in fact liquefied bio methane. Through anaerobic digestion
        or fermentation biodegradable materials can be converted into biogas. This
        gas consists of mostly bio methane, carbondioxide and several other gases.
        It is upgraded to bio methane by removing all the unwanted gases - engines
        are very sensitive to the exact composition and energy content of the fuels
        burnt. To then increase the energetic density, bio methane is liquefied and
        bio LNG is obtained.

        This slider sets the energetic share of biodiesel in the diesel mix

        Biodiesel can be made from a range of vegetable or animals fats.
        Seed oils are particularly popular. Diesel produced from algae has captured
        people's imagination, since growing crops for biodiesel often still competes
        for space with growing food. So far, it accounts for only a small percentage
        of the total production of bio-diesel, as it is not commercially viable yet. <br/><br/>
        Engines can run on bio-diesel without modifications, but the vegetable-based diesels
        tend to be rather corrosive to the engine. <br/><br/>

        Diesel is the standard fossil fuel for trains in 'remote' areas
        that lack an electric rail system. Diesel engines are quite efficient and
        sturdy. Due to emissions of fine particulate matter, filters are becoming
        mandatory in most parts of the world.

        Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) is a rather novel shipping fuel. Traditionally,
        large ships use large fractions of oil and smaller vessels typically run on
        diesel-like fuels. Ships transporting large cargo over long distances require
        very powerful engines and energy-rich fuels. Natural gas is an unsuitable
        shipping fuel as its energetic density is very low, but through liquefaction
        it increases by a factor 600 - more than enough to compete with diesel. Since
        LNG is also a clean-burning fossil fuel, it is an alternative shipping fuel
        worth considering.

        Bio-based fuels for navigation are not common. Very large ocean-faring
        vessels tend to use extremely heavy tar-like oil fractions that will probably
        never be replaced by bio-fuels, as this is hardly economical. Furthermore,
        since ships are relatively efficient, you might wonder whether it is a good
        idea  to have them run on bio-fuels. Road transport being far less efficient,
        bio-fuels will have a much larger impact there.

        Large ships use tar-like fractions of oil, which tend to be a waste
        product of all but the most advanced refineries. This makes this fuel very
        cheap (and rich in energy). The smaller a ship becomes, the closer its fuel
        will tend to common diesel. Since ships in domestic navigation are relatively
        small, diesel is a rather common fuel there.

        The larger a ship becomes, the heavier the fuel it uses. Large
        ocean-faring ships use a tar-like substance that is a waste product of all
        but the most advanced refineries. Since these fractions have few other uses
        without being broken down further, they are relatively cheap.

        For international aviation mainly large aircrafts are used and
        they consume primarily kerosene.

        Instead of using fossil kerosene also bio-kerosene can be used
        in the same type of engines; it is a so-called "drop-in fuel". At the moment
        four technologies are certified to supply bio-kerosene to commercial aviation,
        of which the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology is used
        in 90% of the cases. Do consider the impact on land (and sea) use for growing
        the required crops.
