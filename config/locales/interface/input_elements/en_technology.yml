      title: Efficiency of solar panels
      description: "Solar technology is getting more efficient in converting sunlight into electricity.
        This slider allows you to set the future efficiency of solar panels. <br /><br />
        For a standard 1.6m2 solar panel, efficiency and capacity are related in the following way: <br /><br />
        17% efficiency: 272 Wp <br/>
        18% efficiency: 288 Wp <br/>
        19% efficiency: 304 Wp <br/>
        20% efficiency: 320 Wp <br/>
        21% efficiency: 336 Wp <br/>
        22% efficiency: 352 Wp <br/><br />
        <b>Remark 1:</b> The impact of this slider is different for roof top and ground-mount PV.
        For roof top PV, you can set the share of roof surface covered with solar panels in the ETM. Increasing efficiency
        means that the capacity of these solar panels goes up and that more electricity is produced. The number of panels
        installed remains constant. For ground-mount, you can set the installed capacity in the ETM. Increasing efficiency means
        that less solar panels are needed to meet this installed capacity. Installed capacity and produced electricity stay the same.<br/><br/>
        <b>Remark 2:</b> Please note that this slider interacts with the PV cost slider above. If solar panels become more
        efficient, their price per kW goes down.<br/><br/>
        <b>Remark 3:</b> This slider does not affect efficiency of solar thermal and CSP (concentrated solar power).<br/>"
