      title: Demand and supply of captured CO<sub>2</sub> (CCUS)
      short_description: ''
      description: 'This chart shows the amount of captured CO<sub>2</sub> (supply) and the demand for CO<sub>2</sub> from utilisation, storage and export. 
        <br/><br/> <strong>Note</strong>: it is important to balance the supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> in your system. The ETM assumes 
        that excess CO<sub>2</sub> is exported when supply of CO<sub>2</sub> is higher than demand. In reality, it is desirable to
        avoid an excess supply of CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, you should improve the settings of supply and demand of CO<sub>2</sub> 
        in your scenario to avoid export of excess CO<sub>2</sub>.'

      title: "Use of coal gases"
      description: 'This chart shows the use of coal gases, which arise in the steel sector
        when making steel via the blast furnace production route. Various components of this production
        route, such as cokes ovens, basic oxygen furnaces and the blast furnace itself produce gases from
        coal as a side product. These gases can be re-used in the steel making process, used for power
        production or used as feedstock for other products (such as chemicals).'
