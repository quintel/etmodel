      description: "When comparing different types of electricity generation, only
        the vertical position on this graph is relevant for its total cost.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSelect
        different electricity production technologies by 'clicking' them in the legend
        below the graph.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe vertical axis shows all relevant production
        costs of electricity for various generation technologies (in €/MWhe). This
        <strong>includes</strong> finance and capital costs, but <strong>excludes</strong>
        all taxes and subsidies. We call this 'integral production costs'.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        horizontal axis shows the investment costs (in million €/MWe). The horizontal
        position reveals how much money is needed to construct a power plant with
        a certain production capacity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<a href=\"/units\">More information

        For more information, see section 'Supply' and page 'Infrastructure'. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf
        you build more power plants, the high-voltage (HV) grid will need to be extended
        to accommodate the extra power. If you connect more appliances that need electricity,
        you may need to enhance the low-voltage (LV) grid or transformers and cables
        between the LV and medium-voltage (MV) and HV grids. \r\n\r\n"
