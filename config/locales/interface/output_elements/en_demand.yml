        efficiency and sustainability of cooling production. In order to reduce cooling
        demand, houses will need to be better ventilated, for example.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn

        energy used for cooking is dependent on the technologies are used for cooking.
        Will households keep using mostly gas, or will they switch to electric cooking
        or any of the other available technologies? It all changes the energy mix
        used for cooking."
