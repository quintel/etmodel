        energy used for cooking is dependent on the technologies are used for cooking.
        Will households keep using mostly gas, or will they switch to electric cooking
        or any of the other available technologies? It all changes the energy mix
        used for cooking."

      title: Supply and demand of heat from local CHPs
      description: |
        This chart shows local combined heat and power (CHP) that supply heat to the agriculture
        sector and shows the final demand for that heat. To see the hourly behaviour of this demand and
        supply, you can go to the
        <a href="/scenario/data/data_export/hourly-curves-for-agriculture-heat">Data export</a>
        section. </br></br>
        The final demand for heat is determined by the "Heat from local CHPs" slider in
        the <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat">Agriculture</a> section. The supply from
        CHPs can be set in <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat-from-local-chps">this</a>
        section. Excess heat is wasted and heat shortages are supplied by a backup burner.
