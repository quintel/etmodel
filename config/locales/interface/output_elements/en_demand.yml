      title: Supply and demand of heat from local CHPs
      description: |
        This chart shows local combined heat and power (CHP) that supply heat to the agriculture
        sector and shows the final demand for that heat. To see the hourly behaviour of this demand and
        supply, you can go to the
        <a href="/scenario/data/data_export/hourly-curves-for-agriculture-heat">Data export</a>
        section. </br></br>
        The final demand for heat is determined by the "Heat from local CHPs" slider in
        the <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat">Agriculture</a> section. The supply from
        CHPs can be set in <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat-from-local-chps">this</a>
        section. Excess heat is wasted and heat shortages are supplied by a backup burner.

        This sankey chart shows local combined heat and power (CHP) that supply heat to the agriculture
        sector. It also shows the electricity production by these
        CHPs and how this relates to the demand / supply from the grid. To see the hourly behaviour of this demand and
        supply, you can go to the
        <a href="/scenario/data/data_export/hourly-curves-for-agriculture-heat">Data export</a>

        This chart shows a breakdown of the energy that transits the region
        in the future by energy source.
        Each of the bars add up to the end result in the end year (the black bar to the far right of the chart)
    heat_aquathermal_demand:
      title: Heat demand for aquathermal sources
      description: |
        This chart shows the demand for heat from aquathermal sources (surface water, waste water, drinking water).
        The chart shows the distribution of heat demand between collective sources (heat networks)
        and individual sources and includes the potential for each aquathermal source for the region, whenever available.
