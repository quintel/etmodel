      short_description:
      description: "Emissions from transport are the result of freight transport, passenger transport,
      aviation or public transport. Apart from energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also non-energetic
      CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of transport. This includes the emissions of international transport 
      if you have allocted them to your scenario."
