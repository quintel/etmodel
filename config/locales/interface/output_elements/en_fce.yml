      title: Greenhouse emissions for fuel production and use (1/4)
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows how much greenhouse gas is emitted during the
        life cycles of the fuels listed below. These emissions (in CO<sub>2</sub>
        equivalents) are broken down into four steps: <br/><br/>\r\n1. Extraction
        - production of the raw material <br/>\r\n2. Treatment - processing the raw
        material into the final form in which the fuel is used <br/>\r\n3. Transportation
        - transporting the fuel to the locations at which it is used <br/>\r\n4. Conversion
        - use of the fuel for production of heat or electricity for example <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe
        last steps also includes any emissions occurring during waste treatment or
        storage.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe numbers and references used to quantify the
        fuel chain emissions can be found in a document that can be <a href='http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1623'
        target='blank'>downloaded from here</a>."
