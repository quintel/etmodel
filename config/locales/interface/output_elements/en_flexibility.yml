      title: Effect of interconnector capacity on electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "The data in this chart is based on a relatively simple four country
        model (including NL, DE, BE and FR). The model optimises the production of
        electricity of the whole system taking interconnector capacities as boundary
        conditions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main assumptions / simplifications used in
        the model are:\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Merit Order can be represented as
        a polynomial of second degree. A smooth function is needed for the optimisation
        to reach a unique solution.</li>\r\n<li>Ramping speeds are not modeled: plants
        can switch on and off instantaneously.</li>\r\n<li>Loop flows are excluded
        (it is not possible for a country to receive its own exported electricity).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn
        this research, each country is represented as one single price\r\nzone comprising
        generation and load with interconnection to neighbouring countries. And only
        cross-border transmission capacities are taken into account. This means that
        constraints within each country are not considered. (see Chapter 4.3.2 of
        <a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/820\" target=\"_blank\">Wind

    import_export_renewables:
      title: Additional renewables vs. marginal electricity costs
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart illustrates the effect that increased renewables have
        on wholesale electricity prices.<br><br>\r\nBecause the Merit Order prioritises
        the production by cheap producers, the increase of Renewable capacity translates
        in lower electricity prices for the country with the capacity. (see <a href=\"/supply/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>)\r\n<br><br>\r\nRenewable production is not dispatchable,
        so whenever there is a surplus of production it will be exported to other
        price-zones (countries in the model), respecting interconnection constraints.\r\nThis
        translates in lower prices also for the importer country because part of its
        demand is met by 'zero-cost' (and possibly negatively priced) supply. "

      title: Interconnection capacity
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the interconnection capacity between the Netherlands,
        Germany, France and Belgium. \r\nLarger capacity allows for higher electricity
        import and export spikes, resulting in better convergence of electricity prices
        across countries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNOTE: the interconnector between Belgium
        and France is asymmetrical."

        target=\"_blank\">http://www.apxgroup.com/market-results/cwe</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        extent of price 'convergence' (how often prices are equal) is a measure for
        the success of market coupling. Coupling can be improved by increasing interconnector
        capacity between countries or by employing smarter market mechanisms."

        \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo generate the curves in this chart we made quite
        a few assumptions, most importantly: \r\n\r\n<ul style=\"overflow: hidden\">\r\n\r\n<li>Excess
        electricity is not exported, but curtailed, stored or converted.</li> \r\n<li>The
        ratio of installed wind and solar capacities (x-axis) is fixed to the ratio
        installed in 2010.</li> \r\n<li>Everything else stays the same; the chart
        does not react to your slider settings.</li> \r\n<li>Only marginal cost are
        displayed; in other words, the curves represent the cost for installing a
        first conversion unit or one more wind turbine. </li> \r\n<li>Future cost
        reductions of technologies are not taken into account (learning effects and
        economy of scale).</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation and a

        documentation</a> which types of electricity demand are considered flexible. </br></br>
        Each bar shows the costs per produced unit of output for a certain flexible electricity demand technology.
        For different technologies the type of energy output can differ. Three costs categories are distinguished:
        CAPEX, OPEX and electricity costs. The electricity costs are calculated using the hourly
        electricity price and the hourly electricity consumption by a technology. For power-to-gas, the hydrogen price
        is given as a reference price. For electricity storage, the reference price is the integral revenue, meaning the
        average revenue per produced unit of electricity. </br></br>
        The integral costs therefore depend on assumptions made about the costs and efficiencies of technologies,
        which you can change in the <a href="/scenario/costs/costs_flexibility/investment-costs-storage-electricity">
        Cost & efficiencies</a> section. It also depends on the installed capacity and willingness to pay of

        load". Negative values mean "surpluses" of energy and positive values "shortages". <br/><br/>

        of energy and positive values "shortages". <br/><br/>
        For network gas and hydrogen an additional line is plotted that shows the moving average of
        the original residual load curve. This is used to split the curve into two timescales and analyse the
        need for flexibility. You can change the period of the moving average

      description: |
        This chart gives a rough estimate for how much long-term flexibility (storage volume)
        is needed in your scenario. The blue (“uncorrected”) line in the chart is created by
        summing up the hourly imbalance in inflexible supply and baseload demand for electricity,
        gas, hydrogen and heat at each hour. <br/><br/>
        The red (“corrected”) line shows the fluctuations in required storage volume if supply
        and demand would balance out over the year. This line is obtained by subtracting the
        annual surplus/deficit from the blue line. Because the cumulative nature of the curve,
        the correction of first hour is added to the correction of the second hour etc. until
        the last hour is corrected to coincide with the level of the first hour. <br/><br/>

        This chart shows you the behaviour of flexible electricity supply and demand technologies.
        It is defined in the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility/#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> which types of technologies are considered flexible.
        In this chart flexible electricity supply is stacked on the
        positive axis, while flexible electricity demand is stacked on the negative axis.
        <br/><br/>
        The chart also shows the residual load curve, which is the difference between the
        inflexible electricity supply and demand. See our
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/residual-load-curves">
        Flexibility section</a> for more information. If the residual load curve is positive,
        the inflexible supply is insufficient to meet inflexible (or baseload) demand. If the
        residual load curve is negative, there is an excess of inflexible supply. Flexible
        demand and supply technologies are needed to balance these shortages and excesses. <br/><br/>
        Additionally, when the prices are right, flexible supply technologies can produce additional
        electricity for flexible demand technologies, which is why the stacked areas in the chart
        do not always align with the residual load curve. Whether the prices are right depends
        on the clearing of the electricity market, which you can read more about in our

      title: Flexible hydrogen supply and demand per hour
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This chart shows you the behaviour of flexible hydrogen supply and demand technologies.
        It is defined in the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility/#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> which types of technologies are considered flexible.
        In this chart flexible hydrogen supply is stacked on the
        positive axis, while flexible hydrogen demand is stacked on the negative axis.
        <br/><br/>
        The chart also shows the residual load curve, which is the difference between the
        inflexible hydrogen supply and demand. See our
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/residual-load-curves">
        Flexibility section</a> for more information. If the residual load curve is positive,
        the inflexible supply is insufficient to meet inflexible (or baseload) demand. If the
        residual load curve is negative, there is an excess of inflexible supply. Flexible
        demand and supply technologies are needed to balance these shortages and excesses. <br/><br/>
        When the prices are right, flexible supply technologies can produce additional
        electricity for flexible demand technologies, which is why the stacked areas in the chart
        do not always align with the residual load curve. Whether the prices are right depends
        on the clearing of the hydrogen market, which you can read more about in our
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order/" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>.

    need_for_flexibility:
      title: Need for flexibility on different timescales
      short_description:
      description: |
        This table analyses the imbalance in inflexible supply and demand (the residual load curve)
        for network gas and hydrogen, to determine the need for flexibility on different timescales.
        How to interpret this table is explained in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/the-need-for-flexibility-timescales">
        Flexibility overview</a> section. </br></br>
        By clicking on the toggle you can see the residual load curves and the moving average that is
        applied to it to split the curves into different timescales. Alternatively, you can open the
        residual load curve chart by clicking

        This chart shows the absolute installed capacity of the components of hybrid offshore wind. This
        is the result of the (absolute) installed capacity of hybrid offshore wind turbines, together with
        the relative capacities of the offshore electrolyser and offshore electricity cable.

      title: Hybrid offshore wind energy flows
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the annual energy flows of the components of hybrid offshore wind.
        The following components are visible in the chart (when there is energy in- or output through
        these components):
        <ul>
        <li> Wind electricity </li>
        <li> Offshore electrolyser </li>
        <li> Hydrogen network </li>
        <li> Offshore cable: both from wind electricity to the HV network as from the HV network
        to the offshore electrolyser, these indicate the same offshore electricity cable </li>
        <li> HV network: both on the left and right sides of the chart, they indicate the same
        HV network on land </li>
        <li> Curtailment </li>
        <li> Conversion loss </li>
        </ul>
        Wind electricity is either transported to the HV network via the offshore electricity cable,
        or is converted to hydrogen via the offshore electrolyser. Furthermore, additional electricity
        can be transported to the offshore electrolyser from the onshore HV network for hydrogen
        production. <br/><br/>
        See our <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/hybrid-offshore-wind"
        target =\"_blank\">documentation</a> for more information on the behaviour of the hybrid
        offshore wind components. <br/><br/>
        Open <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="capacity_energy_hybrid_offshore"
        data-chart-location="side">this table</a> to get values of installed capacities, peak powers and
        annual energy flows of the hybrid offshore components.
    capacity_energy_hybrid_offshore:
      title: Hybrid offshore wind capacities and energy flows
      short_description:
      description: |
        This table shows the input and output capacity, peak input and output and annual energy
        input and output of the hybrid offshore wind components in the future. <br/><br/>
        The in- and output capacity depict the installed capacity of the components. The peak in- and
        output show the maximum power in a certain hour flowing in and out of the component. The annual
        energy in- and output show the total yearly energy that flows in and out of the component. For the
        annual energy output, this is the useful output (so excluding losses).<br/><br/>
        The hybrid offshore wind turbine is shown with only outputs of energy (electricity). The
        electrolyser has an input of electricity and output of hydrogen. The offshore electricity
        cables both have input and output of electricity. The curtailed electricity component only has input flows
        of electricity. Finally, conversion loss only has annual input flows (of electricity). <br/><br/>
        Note that the ETM takes an annual availability of the hybrid offshore wind turbine and
        electrolyser into account. This is less than 100%. The hourly calculations are also corrected with this
        availability. Specifically, this means that the depicted peak load is always lower than the installed
        capacity of the wind turbine and electrolyser, and subsequently of the offshore cable supplying
        electricity to the offshore electrolyser.
