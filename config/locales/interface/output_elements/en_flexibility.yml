      title: Effect of interconnector capacity on electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "The data in this chart is based on a relatively simple four country
        model (including NL, DE, BE and FR). The model optimises the production of
        electricity of the whole system taking interconnector capacities as boundary
        conditions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main assumptions / simplifications used in
        the model are:\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Merit Order can be represented as
        a polynomial of second degree. A smooth function is needed for the optimisation
        to reach a unique solution.</li>\r\n<li>Ramping speeds are not modeled: plants
        can switch on and off instantaneously.</li>\r\n<li>Loop flows are excluded
        (it is not possible for a country to receive its own exported electricity).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn
        this research, each country is represented as one single price\r\nzone comprising
        generation and load with interconnection to neighbouring countries. And only
        cross-border transmission capacities are taken into account. This means that
        constraints within each country are not considered. (see Chapter 4.3.2 of
        <a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/820\" target=\"_blank\">Wind
        Integration</a>)"
    import_export_renewables:
      title: Additional renewables vs. marginal electricity costs
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart illustrates the effect that increased renewables have
        on wholesale electricity prices.<br><br>\r\nBecause the Merit Order prioritises
        the production by cheap producers, the increase of Renewable capacity translates
        in lower electricity prices for the country with the capacity. (see <a href=\"/supply/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>)\r\n<br><br>\r\nRenewable production is not dispatchable,
        so whenever there is a surplus of production it will be exported to other
        price-zones (countries in the model), respecting interconnection constraints.\r\nThis
        translates in lower prices also for the importer country because part of its
        demand is met by 'zero-cost' (and possibly negatively priced) supply. "

      title: Interconnection capacity
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the interconnection capacity between the Netherlands,
        Germany, France and Belgium. \r\nLarger capacity allows for higher electricity
        import and export spikes, resulting in better convergence of electricity prices
        across countries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNOTE: the interconnector between Belgium
        and France is asymmetrical."
    import_export_cwe:
      title: CWE 'day ahead' electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the 'day-ahead' price of electricity for the
        Central Western European (CWE) countries (BE, DE, FR, LU and NL) for the month
        of January 2014 as published on <a href=\"http://www.apxgroup.com/market-results/cwe/\"
        target=\"_blank\">http://www.apxgroup.com/market-results/cwe</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        extent of price 'convergence' (how often prices are equal) is a measure for
        the success of market coupling. Coupling can be improved by increasing interconnector
        capacity between countries or by employing smarter market mechanisms."

      description: "This chart gives an impression of how the costs of conversion
        technologies compare and at what point it might become economically interesting
        to build first conversion units.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe <b>x-axis</b>
        of the chart displays the total installed generation capacity of wind and
        solar. If values of ~15 GW of wind and solar capacity are exceeded, the first
        occurrences of excess power are observed in The Netherlands. The <b>y-axis</b>
        has the unit € / MWh. In case of wind turbines, it refers to the <i>present</i>
        costs of total electricity production of inland wind turbines, as shown in

        you have installed (if you do not see a line, you installed more than 120
        GW). It is the only thing in the chart that responds to your slider settings.
        \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo generate the curves in this chart we made quite
        a few assumptions, most importantly: \r\n\r\n<ul style=\"overflow: hidden\">\r\n\r\n<li>Excess
        electricity is not exported, but curtailed, stored or converted.</li> \r\n<li>The
        ratio of installed wind and solar capacities (x-axis) is fixed to the ratio
        installed in 2010.</li> \r\n<li>Everything else stays the same; the chart
        does not react to your slider settings.</li> \r\n<li>Only marginal cost are
        displayed; in other words, the curves represent the cost for installing a
        first conversion unit or one more wind turbine. </li> \r\n<li>Future cost
        reductions of technologies are not taken into account (learning effects and
        economy of scale).</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation and a
        complete list of assumptions, have a look at our <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/storage\"

        summing up the hourly imbalance in inflexible supply and baseload demand for electricity, 
        gas, hydrogen and heat at each hour. <br/><br/>
        The red (“corrected”) line shows the fluctuations in required storage volume if supply 
        and demand would balance out over the year. This line is obtained by subtracting the 
        annual surplus/deficit from the blue line. Because the cumulative nature of the curve, 
        the correction of first hour is added to the correction of the second hour etc. until 
        the last hour is corrected to coincide with the level of the first hour. <br/><br/>
