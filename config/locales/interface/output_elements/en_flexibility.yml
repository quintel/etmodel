      title: Effect of interconnector capacity on electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "The data in this chart is based on a relatively simple four country
        model (including NL, DE, BE and FR). The model optimises the production of
        electricity of the whole system taking interconnector capacities as boundary
        conditions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main assumptions / simplifications used in
        the model are:\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Merit Order can be represented as
        a polynomial of second degree. A smooth function is needed for the optimisation
        to reach a unique solution.</li>\r\n<li>Ramping speeds are not modeled: plants
        can switch on and off instantaneously.</li>\r\n<li>Loop flows are excluded
        (it is not possible for a country to receive its own exported electricity).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn
        this research, each country is represented as one single price\r\nzone comprising
        generation and load with interconnection to neighbouring countries. And only
        cross-border transmission capacities are taken into account. This means that
        constraints within each country are not considered. (see Chapter 4.3.2 of
        <a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/820\" target=\"_blank\">Wind
        Integration</a>)"
    import_export_renewables:
      title: Additional renewables vs. marginal electricity costs
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart illustrates the effect that increased renewables have
        on wholesale electricity prices.<br><br>\r\nBecause the Merit Order prioritises
        the production by cheap producers, the increase of Renewable capacity translates
        in lower electricity prices for the country with the capacity. (see <a href=\"/scenario/costs/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>)\r\n<br><br>\r\nRenewable production is not dispatchable,
        so whenever there is a surplus of production it will be exported to other
        price-zones (countries in the model), respecting interconnection constraints.\r\nThis
        translates in lower prices also for the importer country because part of its
        demand is met by 'zero-cost' (and possibly negatively priced) supply. "

      title: Interconnection capacity
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the interconnection capacity between the Netherlands,
        Germany, France and Belgium. \r\nLarger capacity allows for higher electricity
        import and export spikes, resulting in better convergence of electricity prices
        across countries.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNOTE: the interconnector between Belgium
        and France is asymmetrical."

      title: CWE 'day ahead' electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the 'day-ahead' price of electricity for the
        Central Western European (CWE) countries (BE, DE, FR, LU and NL) for the month
        of January 2014 as published on <a href=\"http://www.apxgroup.com/market-results/cwe/\"
        target=\"_blank\">http://www.apxgroup.com/market-results/cwe</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        extent of price 'convergence' (how often prices are equal) is a measure for
        the success of market coupling. Coupling can be improved by increasing interconnector
        capacity between countries or by employing smarter market mechanisms."

      short_description: This chart gives an impression of how the costs of conversion

      description: "This chart gives an impression of how the costs of conversion
        technologies compare and at what point it might become economically interesting
        to build first conversion units.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe <b>x-axis</b>
        of the chart displays the total installed generation capacity of wind and
        solar. If values of ~15 GW of wind and solar capacity are exceeded, the first
        occurrences of excess power are observed in The Netherlands. The <b>y-axis</b>
        has the unit € / MWh. In case of wind turbines, it refers to the <i>present</i>
        costs of total electricity production of inland wind turbines, as shown in
        \r\n<a href=\"/scenario/costs/wind/investment\">'wind turbines' section of
        Costs</a> \r\n\r\nIn case of the storage and conversion technology, the y-axis
        indicates the cost for delivering useful energy via the conversion of excess.
        \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe indicator line shows how much volatile capacity
        you have installed (if you do not see a line, you installed more than 120
        GW). It is the only thing in the chart that responds to your slider settings.
        \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo generate the curves in this chart we made quite
        a few assumptions, most importantly: \r\n\r\n<ul style=\"overflow: hidden\">\r\n\r\n<li>Excess
        electricity is not exported, but curtailed, stored or converted.</li> \r\n<li>The
        ratio of installed wind and solar capacities (x-axis) is fixed to the ratio
        installed in 2010.</li> \r\n<li>Everything else stays the same; the chart
        does not react to your slider settings.</li> \r\n<li>Only marginal cost are
        displayed; in other words, the curves represent the cost for installing a
        first conversion unit or one more wind turbine. </li> \r\n<li>Future cost
        reductions of technologies are not taken into account (learning effects and
        economy of scale).</li> \r\n</ul> \r\n\r\nFor a detailed explanation and a
        complete list of assumptions, have a look at our <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/storage\"

      title: Supply and demand per month
      description: |
        This chart shows the demand and supply of electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat 
        per month. This gives you insight into the balance of your energy system throughout 
        the year: when does imbalance occur? Which carriers are not in balance? If you are 
        curious about the balance within a month, there is an option to zoom in. By clicking 
        on a carrier in a specific month, a new chart opens that zooms in on the hourly values ​​
        of that carrier in that month. </br> </br>
        To get a good picture of this (im)balance, only the baseload energy demand and the must-run 
        and volatile production are shown in this chart. This allows 
        you to clearly see the "need for flexibility" of the system. </br></br>
        What exactly is meant by baseload demand and inflexible supply is explained below:
        <ul> <li> Demand is the end use of the different sectors. This does <b>not</b> include the 
        energy demand of flex technologies that balance the system, such as gas / hydrogen 
        for dispatchable power plants, electricity that enters batteries or gas / hydrogen 
        in gas storage facilities.</li>
        <li> Supply is the must-run and volatile production, such as wind turbines and solar 
        thermal plants. This does <b>not</b> include the production by flex technologies, such as heat 
        / electricity production by dispatchable sources, electricity from batteries or

        This chart is a continuation of the flexibility chart "Supply and demand per month". 
        This chart shows the imbalance between supply and demand for electricity, gas, 
        hydrogen and heat per month. The imbalance is calculated by subtracting the demand 
        from the supply, this is called the "residual load". Negative values mean "surpluses" 
        of energy and positive values "shortages". This way you can gain insight into the 
        balance of your energy system throughout the year: in which months does an imbalance occur? 
        Which carriers are not in balance? Are these shortages or surpluses of energy? If you are 
        curious about the imbalance within a month, you can click on that specific month and a chart 
        will open with "residual load" profiles for that month.</br></br>

    flexibility_hourly_all_carriers_cumulative_imbalance:
      title: Need for seasonal storage
      description: |
        This chart is a continuation of the flexibility chart "Imbalance per month". It is 
        advisable to look at that chart first. An explanation of the lines is shown below:
        <ul> <li> The line excluding correction in the chart shows the sum of all shortages and surpluses of 
        electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat throughout the year. When the line is rising, it means 
        there were net surpluses in that hour and when the line is falling, it means there 
        were net shortages. If the end point of the chart is higher than the starting point, 
        this means that energy surpluses outweigh deficits.<br /><br />
        Surpluses at one point in time can be used to resolve deficits at a later point, either by 
        storing the surpluses or by converting one carrier into another. By comparing the start and end point of this line, you can see how much 
        "leeway" you have to use these surpluses in your scenario to make up for the shortages. 
        So how much conversion / storage losses you can afford to eventually balance the system.</li><br/ ><br/ >
        <li> For the corrected line it is assumed that the energy system is already in balance at an annual level: that all generated 
        energy goes somewhere and all required energy comes from somewhere. This gives a rough 
        estimate of your total required storage capacity to ensure that carriers can be used 
        at the right time. This total required storage capacity can be read from the highest 
        value of this line. </li>
