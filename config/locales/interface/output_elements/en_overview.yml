      title: Primary energy use
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph shows total primary energy use for your country in
        the present and future years.<br/><br/>You can click <u>Change chart</u>
        above the graph, to select different graphs about energy demand.
    co2_emissions:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This chart compares CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1990, the present, and the future. 
        The year 1990 is often used as a reference year in CO<sub>2</sub> targets.
        <br/><br/> 
        For the emissions of 1990, the ETM considers only domestic, energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> 
        emissions and the non-energy-related emissions from the use of natural gas in the fertilizer sector.
        Non-energy-related emissions in other sectors and other greenhouse gases (such as methane) are not included. 
        For the emissions of the current and model year, the emissions from the production of hydrogen and ammonia 
        that are used in non-energy-related applications are also included. 
        In the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-overview-per-sector" target="_blank">documentation</a>,
        you can find more information.
    renewability:
      title: Renewability of final demand
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph shows how the percentage of sustainable final energy
        use changes between now and the future year. This is the result of your choices.<br/><br/>Final
        energy use means that losses during conversions of energy carriers to electricity
        or heat are not taken into account.
    mekko_of_primary_demand:
      title: Primary energy use
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph compares primary energy consumption in your country
        (horizontal axis) by various segments of society and energy sources (vertical
        axis). Primary use means we are looking at the origins of derived energy carriers
        like heat, electricity and transport fuels. We also take into consideration
        the losses that occur when these energy carriers are made.  <br/><br/>The
        graph for the future is the result of your choices in determining the future
        energy demand and the future energy generation. The efficiencies for making
        heat and power are higher in the future than in the present.<br/><br/>Example:
        Economic growth leads to increased energy demand. Energy saving and modern
        technologies lead to lower energy demand. Choices for heat pumps and electric
        transport lead to lower total energy demand, but an increase in demand for
        electricity. How electricity, heat and fuels are generated determines the
        primary energy demand.<br/><br/>You can click <u>Change chart</u>

    mekko_of_storage_volume:
      title: Installed storage volume per carrier
      short_description:
      description: |
       The depicted graph shows the installed storage volume categorized by energy carrier and storage type.
       It's important to note that the entirety of this installed storage volume may not be utilized in your specific scenario. 
       For example, the volume allocated for hydrogen storage is set within the scenario. 
       The heat volume follows is not set within the scenario but follows from the maximal needed heat capacity.
    source_of_electricity_production:
      title: Electricity production
      short_description:
      description: |
        This graph gives a breakdown of current and future electricity
        production into types of power plants. By default, the future electricity
        mix is the same as the present one. You can choose how to meet future energy
        demand with the sliders to the left of the graph. <br/><br/>Demand for
        electricity is indicated by the horizontal line. If the resulting electricity
        production is higher than demand, the model will automatically start exporting
        this electricity. If you do not build enough production capacity, the model
        will import electricity.

        used to generate electricity and heat is shown in the middle. On the right
        you can see where the energy is used. <br/>Floating over the chart with
