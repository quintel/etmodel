      title: Primary energy use
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph shows total primary energy use for your country in
        the present and future years.<br/><br/>You can click <u>Change chart</u>
        above the graph, to select different graphs about energy demand.
    co2_emissions:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      short_description: ''
      description: |
       This graph compares CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between
        1990, the present and the future. The year 1990 is often used as a reference
        year for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions targets.<br/><br/>The ETM takes into account energetic
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are emitted in domestic energy use and production, as well as 
        non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the Fertilizers sector. Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions in other sectors and other green house gases (e.g. methane) are not included. You can find
        more information in the 
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-overview-per-sector"

    renewability:
      title: Renewability of final demand
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph shows how the percentage of sustainable final energy
        use changes between now and the future year. This is the result of your choices.<br/><br/>Final
        energy use means that losses during conversions of energy carriers to electricity
        or heat are not taken into account.
    mekko_of_primary_demand:
      title: Primary energy use
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph compares primary energy consumption in your country
        (horizontal axis) by various segments of society and energy sources (vertical
        axis). Primary use means we are looking at the origins of derived energy carriers
        like heat, electricity and transport fuels. We also take into consideration
        the losses that occur when these energy carriers are made.  <br/><br/>The
        graph for the future is the result of your choices in determining the future
        energy demand and the future energy generation. The efficiencies for making
        heat and power are higher in the future than in the present.<br/><br/>Example:
        Economic growth leads to increased energy demand. Energy saving and modern
        technologies lead to lower energy demand. Choices for heat pumps and electric
        transport lead to lower total energy demand, but an increase in demand for
        electricity. How electricity, heat and fuels are generated determines the
        primary energy demand.<br/><br/>You can click <u>Change chart</u>

    source_of_electricity_production:
      title: Electricity production
      short_description: ''
      description: |
        This graph gives a breakdown of current and future electricity
        production into types of power plants. By default, the future electricity
        mix is the same as the present one. You can choose how to meet future energy
        demand with the sliders to the left of the graph. <br/><br/>Demand for
        electricity is indicated by the horizontal line. If the resulting electricity
        production is higher than demand, the model will automatically start exporting
        this electricity. If you do not build enough production capacity, the model
        will import electricity.

        Sankey diagrams show how, where and how much energy is used. At
        the left this diagram starts with primary energy forms. The energy that is
        used to generate electricity and heat is shown in the middle. On the right
        you can see where the energy is used. <br/>Floating over the chart with
        you mouse will highlight different parts and reveal more information.<br><br>Note
        that losses due to distribution and refinement are not taking into account.
