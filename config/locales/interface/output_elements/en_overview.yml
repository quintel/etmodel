      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      short_description: ''
      description: "This graph compares energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between
        1990, the present and the future. The year 1990 is often used as a reference
        year for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions targets. The red line indicates the target
        you have set under 'Goals'. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe graph only displays energetic
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are emitted in domestic energy use and production.
        Non-energetic emissions are not included. Non-energetic emissions are related
        to processes other than the production of usable energy like electricity or
        heat. An example of such emissions are the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are
        released from cement during its making. The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related
        to the needed energy for cement production <em>do</em> count as energetic
        emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\L\LNote: When the Fuel Chain Emissions module
        is turned on, the graph also includes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents of other
        greenhouse gas emissions, like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)
        related to the fuel chain in this graph. Non-energetic emissions and greenhouse
        gas emissions not related to the fuel chain are not included.`"

        use changes between now and the future year. This is the result of your choices.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFinal
        energy use means that losses during conversions of energy carriers to electricity
        or heat are not taken into account."
    mekko_of_primary_demand:
      title: Primary energy use
      short_description: ''
      description: "This graph compares primary energy consumption in your country
        (horizontal axis) by various segments of society and energy sources (vertical
        axis). Primary use means we are looking at the origins of derived energy carriers
        like heat, electricity and transport fuels. We also take into consideration
        the losses that occur when these energy carriers are made.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        graph for the future is the result of your choices in determining the future
        energy demand and the future energy generation. The efficiencies for making
        heat and power are higher in the future than in the present.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nExample:
        Economic growth leads to increased energy demand. Energy saving and modern
        technologies lead to lower energy demand. Choices for heat pumps and electric
        transport lead to lower total energy demand, but an increase in demand for
        electricity. How electricity, heat and fuels are generated determines the
        primary energy demand.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nYou can click '<u>Change chart</u>'

      short_description: ''
      description: "This graph gives a breakdown of current and future electricity
        production into types of power plants. By default, the future electricity
        mix is the same as the present one. You can choose how to meet future energy
        demand with the sliders to the left of the graph. <br/><br/>\r\nDemand for
        electricity is indicated by the horizontal line. If the resulting electricity
        production is higher than demand, the model will automatically start exporting
        this electricity. If you do not build enough production capacity, the model
        will import electricity. "

      short_description: ''
      description: "This 'Mekko' chart shows the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the
        sectors of the ETM subdivided by final demand carriers. For each final demand
        carrier, transformation and transportation losses have been taken into account.
        \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor example, the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with
        electricity in the household sector is calculated by tracing back all transformations
        until we arrive at the primary carriers such as natural oil and coal."
