      description: 'This chart shows the peak power demand as well as available production
        capacity. It shows what shares of available production capacity are reliable
        and unreliable. Things such as wind turbines and solar PV panels are examples
        of unreliable power production. If the peak power demand is higher than the
        reliable capacity the loss of load probability will increase. '

        Indirect emissions from electricity production, for example emissions from hydrogen power plants or from
        imported electricity, are therefore left out of the chart.

      short_description: CO2 biomass
      description: "Which part of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from biomass is relevant
        to the environment is uncertain and speculative. This chart serves to explore
        the (potential) amount of these emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBesides the official
        UNFCCC accounted  CO<sub>2</sub> emission this chart also shows the CO<sub>2</sub>
        which is emitted due the use of biomass and is (potentially) relevant for
        climate change. Which part of the biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should
        be shown can be set with the sliders in the CO<sub>2</sub> biomass section.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        chart only displays energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are emitted
        in domestic energy use and production. Non-energetic emissions are not included.
        Non-energetic emissions are related to processes other than the production
        of usable energy like electricity or heat. An example of such emissions are
        the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are released from cement during its making.
        The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to the needed energy for cement production
        <em>do</em> count as energetic emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\L\r\nNote: When the
        Fuel Chain Emissions module is turned on, the chart also includes CO<sub>2</sub>
        equivalents of other greenhouse gas emissions, like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)
        or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) related to the fuel chain in this chart.
        Non-energetic emissions and greenhouse gas emissions not related to the fuel
        chain are not included."

      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart shows the additional costs and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        for different backup options for volatile power. Volatile technologies like
        wind or solar cannot always be relied upon to produce power. This is unfortunate,
        because most backup plants use fossil fuels, making volatile electricity less
        free and clean than many people claim or expect it to be. The choice of a
        backup technology is therefore an important one, as this will determine the
        effective emissions and costs of electricity for volatile electricity production.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        additional costs and emissions are both expressed per MWh<sub>e</sub> of the
        volatile electricity production in your scenario."
