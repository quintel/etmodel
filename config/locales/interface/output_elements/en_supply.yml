        the (potential) amount of these emissions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBesides the official
        UNFCCC accounted  CO<sub>2</sub> emission this chart also shows the CO<sub>2</sub>
        which is emitted due the use of biomass and is (potentially) relevant for
        climate change. Which part of the biomass CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should
        be shown can be set with the sliders in the CO<sub>2</sub> biomass section.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        chart only displays energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are emitted
        in domestic energy use and production. Non-energetic emissions are not included.
        Non-energetic emissions are related to processes other than the production
        of usable energy like electricity or heat. An example of such emissions are
        the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are released from cement during its making.
        The CO<sub>2</sub> emissions related to the needed energy for cement production
        <em>do</em> count as energetic emissions."

      description: "This chart shows the additional costs and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
        for different backup options for volatile power. Volatile technologies like
        wind or solar cannot always be relied upon to produce power. This is unfortunate,
        because most backup plants use fossil fuels, making volatile electricity less
        free and clean than many people claim or expect it to be. The choice of a
        backup technology is therefore an important one, as this will determine the
        effective emissions and costs of electricity for volatile electricity production.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        additional costs and emissions are both expressed per MWh<sub>e</sub> of the
        volatile electricity production in your scenario."

    co2_intensity_of_hydrogen_production:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> intensity per hydrogen production type
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of different hydrogen production technologies
        in kg CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh hydrogen produced. You can find power-to-gas (P2G) in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-hydrogen">Conversion to hydrogen</a>
        section. All other technologies can be found in the
        <a href="/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production">Hydrogen production</a> section. </br></br>
        The emitted CO<sub>2</sub> intensity is calculated by dividing the primary emissions
        of each technology by its hydrogen production. For the captured CO<sub>2</sub> intensity
        the captured emissions are used. See our
        <a href="https://https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles#modelling-principles" target="_blank">documentation</a>
        for more information on the calculation of primary emissions. </br></br>
        In the ETM, primary emissions are calculated on a yearly basis. In most cases, for example steam methane
        reforming, this approach suffices since its
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emission-factors" target="_blank">emission factor</a>
        is fixed throughout the year. For power-to-gas however, the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of the
        electricity input can change every hour. Therefore, for power-to-gas first the CO<sub>2</sub>
        intensity of electricity production is calculated. This is then combined with the hourly
        electricity input of power-to-gas to determine the average hourly CO<sub>2</sub> intensity. </br></br>
        Finally, a CO<sub>2</sub> intensity threshold value that determines whether, according to the 
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2139&from=EN" target="_blank">
        European Commission</a>, the manufacturing of hydrogen qualifies as "contributing substantially to climate 
        change mitigation" has been added to the chart. This threshold is set at 3 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg of 
        H<sub>2</sub> produced and has been converted to kg per MWh.
