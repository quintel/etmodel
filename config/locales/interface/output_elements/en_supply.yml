        demand and when it is not possible to fill this gap with electricity import
        or flexible technologies such as electricity storage. The volume and peak capacity of the
        total electricity demand is provided to give an indication of the magnitude of power

    co2_intensity_of_hydrogen_production:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> intensity per hydrogen production type
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of different hydrogen production technologies
        in kg CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh hydrogen produced. You can find power-to-gas (P2G, both onshore and offshore P2G or shown
        under the same label in this chart) in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_conversion/conversion-to-hydrogen">Conversion to hydrogen</a>
        section. All other technologies can be found in the
        <a href="/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production">Hydrogen production</a> section. </br></br>
        The emitted CO<sub>2</sub> intensity is calculated by dividing the primary emissions
        of each technology by its hydrogen production. For the captured CO<sub>2</sub> intensity
        the captured emissions are used. See our
        <a href="https://https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles#modelling-principles" target="_blank">documentation</a>
        for more information on the calculation of primary emissions. </br></br>
        In the ETM, primary emissions are calculated on a yearly basis. In most cases, for example steam methane
        reforming, this approach suffices since its
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-emission-factors" target="_blank">emission factor</a>
        is fixed throughout the year. For power-to-gas however, the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of the
        electricity input can change every hour. Therefore, for power-to-gas first the CO<sub>2</sub>
        intensity of electricity production is calculated. This is then combined with the hourly
        electricity input of power-to-gas to determine the average hourly CO<sub>2</sub> intensity. </br></br>
        Finally, a CO<sub>2</sub> intensity threshold value that determines whether, according to the
        <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2139&from=EN" target="_blank">
        European Commission</a>, the manufacturing of hydrogen qualifies as "contributing substantially to climate
        change mitigation" has been added to the chart. This threshold is set at 3 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per kg of
        H<sub>2</sub> produced and has been converted to kg per MWh. </br></br>
        The labels used in this graph represent the process in which this energy carrier is used.
        For example, "Ammonia" stands for Ammonia reforming, and "LOHC" stands for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) reforming.

        in the scenario are depicted to have production costs of 0 €/MWh. In reality, the production costs per MWh are infinite since
        there is no hydrogen production by this technology.
