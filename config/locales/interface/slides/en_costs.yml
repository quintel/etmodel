    costs_flexibility_demand_curtailment:
      title: Value of Lost Load
      short_description:
      description: |
        In hours when the total electricity demand exceeds the total electricity supply,
        a <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/loss-of-load-expectation/"
        target ="_blank">loss of load</a> occurs. The electricity price during these hours 
        is represented in the model by the Value of Lost Load (VoLL). This is the value that 
        electricity consumers attribute to receiving an uninterupted electricity supply, or 
        in other words, the costs they would incur for a supply disruption.
