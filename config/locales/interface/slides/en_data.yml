      title: Overview
      short_description:
      description: |
        In this section you can find extensive data downloads for the calculations underpinning your scenario. <br/><br/>
        You can choose to download <b>yearly results</b> (flows, emissions, demand and supply), additional <b>specifications</b>
        (capacities, storage, technologies, number of units and costs) or you can download <b>hourly results</b> (electricity,
        household heat, gas, hydrogen and heat networks). <br/><br/>
        You can also upload hourly demand and supply curves for your scenario in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/curve_upload/upload-curves">Flexibility → Modify hourly profiles </a> section.

      title: Present year data
      short_description:
      description: |
        When you start a (new) scenario in the Energy Transition Model, source data for the present year is loaded
        into the model. This data represents the current state of the energy system of the region that you have selected. This
        present state is used as the basis for modelling your future scenario and is unique for every
        region. <br/><br/>
        Various data is required to load the Energy Transition Model, such as final energy demand per sector,
        installed capacities of power plants and characteristics of the region such as the population size,
        number of houses, roof surface suitable for solar panels etc.
      country_description: |
        When possible, we use open source energy balances from <a href="https://doi.org/10.2908/NRG_BAL_C"target="_blank">Eurostat</a> as a
        basis for our country datasets. Additionally, analyses are performed
        to provide any additonal data that is required to create a complete dataset. These analyses can be found on
        <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/source_analyses"target="_blank">this GitHub page</a>, in separate folders per country.
        In the future we plan to increase transparancy to our users by adding the
        country datasets to our online <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">ETM Dataset Manager</a>.
      subregion_description: |
        You can view the source data for your region in a clear
        and structured way in the ETM Dataset Manager, which can be visited by clicking on the button below.

        <b>Note</b>: the following distinctions should be considered when comparing the costs data
        export with the cost charts
        (<a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="costs_overview" data-chart-location="side">overview</a> or
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="costs_overview_detailed" data-chart-location="side">

        <ol>
          <li>
          The "CO<sub>2</sub> emission costs" series in the cost charts is equal to the sum of the
          column "CO2 emission costs (eur)" in the data export.
          </li>
          <li>
          The "Captured biogenic CO<sub>2</sub> costs" series in the cost charts is equal to the sum
          of the column "Captured biogenic CO2 costs (eur)" in the data export.

          The columns "Total costs (eur)", "CO2 emission costs (eur)" and "Captured biogenic CO2

          in the cost charts.
          </li>
          <li>
          Finally, in the cost charts, "CCUS costs" are allocated to a dedicated series, while
          in the data export, they are part of the costs in the "Total costs (eur)" column.

    data_visuals_land_use_solar_wind:
      title: Land use of solar and wind energy
      short_description:
      description: |
        Solar and wind technologies partially compete for space. The chart in this section shows
        the total land use of all solar and wind technologies.
        In particular, it is possible to differentiate between large-scale and small-scale inland wind turbines
        using the sliders below.
        Please note that this split is for visual purposes only and does not affect the outcomes of this scenario.
        <br/><br/>
        The full specifications of each technology, including electricity production and number of units,
        are available in the table
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="land_use_solar_wind" data-chart-location="side">
        Land use of solar and wind (table)</a>
        <br/><br/>
        <b> Note: </b> Solar PVT panels and solar thermal panels are included in the chart and table.
        The ETM considers PVT panels (and solar thermal panels) primarily as a heating technology in combination with a heat pump.
        To adjust the share of a PVT heat pump system for space heating and hot water or to adjust the number of solar thermal panels, go to the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water">
        Households space heating and hot water</a> section.
    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order_price:
      title: Hourly curves for electricity
      short_description:
      description: |
        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs.
        Based on the hourly demand, the ETM calculates which power plants are
        dispatched each hour. Combined with the marginal costs of these
        plants, the ETM calculates the hourly electricity price. The ETM
        assumes that this price is equal to the marginal costs of the most
        expensive plant running.

        <br/><br/>

        Note that any mismatches between hourly supply and demand are due to
        insufficient production capacity in the scenario. These mismatches
        (resulting in blackhout hours) are represented in the 'deficit' column
        in the electricity load curves data export.

        <br/><br/>

        The hourly load curves for all electricity production and consumption for your scenario, as well as the price curve, can be downloaded following the links below.

        section for more information). </br></br>
