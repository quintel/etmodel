      title: Present year data
      short_description:
      description: |
        When you start a (new) scenario in the Energy Transition Model, source data for the present year is loaded
        into the model. This data represents the current state of the energy system of the region that you have selected. This
        present state is used as the basis for modelling your future scenario and is unique for every
        region. <br/><br/>
        Various data is required to load the Energy Transition Model, such as final energy demand per sector,
        installed capacities of power plants and characteristics of the region such as the population size,
        number of houses, roof surface suitable for solar panels etc.
      country_description: |
        For country datasets we currently use the International Energy Agency (IEA) energy balances as a basis.
        Unfortunately this data is not open source, so it is not possible to share directly. We aim to use an open source energy balance in the near future.
        Besides the IEA energy balance other data is required, this data can be found on <a href="https://github.com/quintel/etdataset-public/tree/master/source_analyses"
        target="_blank">this GitHub page</a> in separate folders per country. In the future we plan to increase transparancy for users to find underlying sources by adding the
        country datasets to our online <a href="https://data.energytransitionmodel.com/" target="_blank">ETM Dataset Manager</a>.

        You can view the source data for your region in a clear
        and structured way in the ETM Dataset Manager, which can be visited by clicking on the button below.

    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order_price:
      title: Hourly curves for electricity
      short_description:
      description: |
        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs.
        Based on the hourly demand, the ETM calculates which power plants are
        dispatched each hour. Combined with the marginal costs of these
        plants, the ETM calculates the hourly electricity price. The ETM
        assumes that this price is equal to the marginal costs of the most
        expensive plant running.

        <br/><br/>

        Note that any mismatches between hourly supply and demand are due to
        insufficient production capacity in the scenario. These mismatches
        (resulting in blackhout hours) are represented in the 'deficit' column
        in the electricity load curves data export.

        <br/><br/>

        The hourly load curves for all electricity production and consumption for your scenario, as well as the price curve, can be downloaded following the links below.
