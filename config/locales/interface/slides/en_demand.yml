    demand_industry:
      title: Energy demand in the industry
      short_description:
      description: "In most countries industry is responsible for the largest part
        of the energy use. Because this industry is very diverse, we split it up in
        different sectors. We follow the division of the industry into subsectors
        as used by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as much as possible. The
        chart on the right shows the energy use of each of these sectors. In the slides
        below you can set the growth and efficiency improvements of each sector. A
        number of smaller sectors have been grouped in <a href=\"/scenario/demand/industry/other\"
        > Other industry</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSome sectors have been modelled in
        more detail. This makes it possible to explore potential structural changes
        to these sectors as a result of the energy transition. You can draw inspiration
        for this from the report <a href=\"http://refman.energytransitionmodel.com/publications/2037\"

    demand_industry_chemical_refineries:
      title: Refineries
      short_description:
      description: "Refineries turn crude oil into oil products. These oil products
        are used as fuel in the transport sector or feedstock in the chemical industry.
        Refineries make most of their money by selling transport fuels. The demand
        for these fuels will most probably change as transport technologies change.
        You can set these technologies in <a href=\"/scenario/demand/transport\" >
        the transport sector</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn the ETM the output of the refineries
        is not directly coupled to domestic demand for transport fuels. Potential
        shortages can be imported and excess production can be exported. This also
        holds for oil products that are used as feedstock in the chemical industry.
        Below you can set the growth and efficiency improvements of the refineries
        separately. Note that the demand for refinery products is set by global markets. "
    demand_industry_chemical_fertilizers:
      title: Fertilizers
      short_description:
      description: "Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) constitutes the basis of all nitrogen-based
        fertilizers. The most important step in producing ammonia is reacting hydrogen
        with nitrogen. At the moment the required hydrogen is produced locally by
        stripping natural gas in a steam methane reforming (SMR) plant, which produces
        CO<sub>2</sub> as a side product. In the future, it may become possible to
        use hydrogen from a central hydrogen network. This network delivers hydrogen
        originating from different processes that can be chosen in the \r\n<a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\"
        >hydrogen production slide</a>."
    demand_industry_chemical_other:
      title: Chemicals
      short_description:

        has been excluded from this sector and is represented as a <a href=\"/scenario/demand/industry/fertilizers\"
        > separate sector</a>. \r\n<br><br/>\r\nThe growth you indicate here is due
        to economic and population growth. This growth is excluding efficiencies and
        technological changes you can indicate in the subsections below.\r\n<br></br>\r\nCaution:
        not all heat production technologies are suited to supply the full heat demand.

    demand_industry_steel:
      title: Steel
      short_description:
      description: 'Steel processing requires energy-intensive furnaces. Several alternatives
        are possible. The percentage of recycled steel that can be used as input varies
        per technology: blast furnaces and cyclone furnaces use up to 20% recycled
        steel and electric ovens are used for recycling only. The cyclone furnaces
        are unique in the sense that they can run on 100% bio-fuel.'

    demand_transport_international_transport:
      title: International transport
      short_description:
      description: Currently emissions from international transport are not included
        in national energy statistics, since it is complex to decide to which country
        they should be allocated. However, international aviation and navigation are
        responsible for more than 4.5% of the global GHG emissions (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport_en">EC
        Climate Action</a>). Insight in the energy demand is needed in this sector
        in order to take measures reducing their emissions. Therefore, in this model
        it is possible to include international aviation and navigation to a desired
        percentage by using the sliders below.
