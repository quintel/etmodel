    supply_agriculture_local_heat:
      title: Heat from local CHPs
      short_description:
      description: |
        In this section you can determine how you want to meet the final demand for heat from
        local combined heat and power (CHP) production in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/agriculture/heat"> Heat</a> section above. The chart on the right shows you
        the heat balance of these local CHPs. For a more detailed overview, have a look at the sankey chart
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="agriculture_sankey" data-chart-location="side">
        Local heat and electricity production in agriculture.</a></br></br>
        If the total local heat supply from these CHPs exceeds the demand from agriculture,
        the excess heat is wasted. If supply falls short of demand, the shortage is supplied
        by a back-up gas burner. Local electricity excesses and shortages are exchanged with
        the electricity network.

        The energy demand of a building depends strongly on its function,
        but also on building characteristics such as the level of insulation.
        The typical heat demand for buildings can be set here per construction period. See the

    demand_export_energy_introduction:
      title: Introduction
      short_description:
      description: |
        Many regions deal with energy flows that merely pass through the region and
        are not consumed or produced by parts of the local energy system. These flows
        of energy (carriers) are called <b>transit flows</b>, as they are only 'in transit'
        in the region. An example of such transit flow is the import of oil through a
        harbor and subsequent export via local pipelines to the hinterland, with no oil
        consumption taking place in between.
        <br /> <br />
        These can be contractual obligations to export certain amounts of energy to
        neighbouring regions, or flows of energy that only pass through the region, for
        instance from a port to the hinterland.

        In order to model transit flows in your scenario, you can set the <i>inflexible</i>
        export volumes of several energy (carriers) using the sliders below. Setting an

    demand_households_demand_growth:
      title: Development of demand
      short_description:
      description: |
        Changes in demand influence the household energy demand.
        Some of these changes scale with population, whereas others scale with the
        number of residences. These changes do <strong>not</strong> include efficiency
        improvements and technological changes. These you can indicate in the slides
        below.
    demand_households_heating:
      title: Space heating & hot water
      short_description:
      description: |
        Households demand for space heating and hot water can be supplied many different technologies.
        The allocation of the technologies to residences of a specific type and construction period
        is determined in the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/households_heating_order/merit-order">
        Merit order</a> section. The resulting allocation is visualized in
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="residential_heating_technologies" data-chart-location="side">
        this chart</a>. See the

    demand_households_insulation:
      title: Heat demand & insulation
      short_description:
      description: |
        The energy demand of a residence depends on building characteristics, especially
        the level of insulation, but other factors such as behaviour and desired comfort
        also play a role. The typical heat demand for residences can be set here, per
        residence type and construction period. See the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/demand#households" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information.
    demand_households_lighting:

        Lighting is a small but obvious part of a household's need for energy.
    demand_households_population:
      title: Population & housing stock
      short_description:
      description: |
        Populations grow or decline over time. New residences can be constructed
        and old residences can demolished.
    demand_households_heating_producers_order:
      title: Merit order
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water">
        Space heating & hot water</a> section, the mix of heating technologies is set.
        How the technologies are allocated to residences of a specific type and
        construction period (see
        <a href="/scenario/demand/households/population-and-housing-stock">
        Population & housing stock</a>) is determined here. </br></br>
        It is assumed that the preference of technologies is to supply to the most
        recently constructed residences. The technology that is first in the merit order
        has first pick and will be installed in the newest residences, typically with the best
        insulation. The technology that is last in the merit order will then supply the
        oldest residences that are typically badly insulated. See the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/demand#households" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information.
    demand_households_heating_technologies:
      title: Capacities
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water">
        Space heating & hot water</a> section, the mix of heating technologies is set.
        The dimensioning of these techologies can be adjusted here. </br></br>
        It can occur that the default heat capacity of a technology is too low to meet the demand
        of the residence in which it is installed. One option is then to dimension the
        technology properly, by changing the heat capacity below. Another option is to
        install a different technology, which can be done by changing the
        <a href="/scenario/demand/households_heating_order/merit-order">
        Merit order</a>. See the

    demand_industry:
      title: Energy demand in the industry
      short_description:
      description: "In most countries industry is responsible for the largest part
        of the energy use. Because this industry is very diverse, we split it up in
        different sectors. We follow the division of the industry into subsectors
        as used by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as much as possible. The
        chart on the right shows the energy use of each of these sectors. In the slides
        below you can set the growth and efficiency improvements of each sector. A
        number of smaller sectors have been grouped in <a href=\"/scenario/demand/industry/other\"

      title: Refineries
      short_description:
      description: "Refineries turn crude oil into oil products. These oil products
        are used as fuel in the transport sector or feedstock in the chemical industry.
        Refineries make most of their money by selling transport fuels. The demand
        for these fuels will most probably change as transport technologies change.
        You can set these technologies in <a href=\"/scenario/demand/transport\" >
        the transport sector</a>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn the ETM the output of the refineries
        is not directly coupled to domestic demand for transport fuels. Potential
        shortages can be imported and excess production can be exported. This also
        holds for oil products that are used as feedstock in the chemical industry.
        Below you can set the growth and efficiency improvements of the refineries
        separately. Note that the demand for refinery products is set by global markets. "
    demand_industry_chemical_fertilizers:

      short_description:
      description: |
        Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) constitutes the basis of all nitrogen-based
        fertilizers. The most important step in producing ammonia is reacting hydrogen
        with nitrogen. At the moment the required hydrogen is produced locally by
        stripping natural gas in a steam methane reforming (SMR). </br></br>
        In the future, you might use hydrogen from a central hydrogen network, instead
        of producing it locally with the SMR. It may even become possible to source the
        ammonia centrally, bypassing the need for local ammonia production entirely.

        transport'</a>, <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_freight_transport/applications">'Freight
        transport'</a> and <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-transport">'International
        transport'</a>. There you can specify how transport demand will change
        in the future, which means of transport will be used and which drive technologies
        will prevail. In the <a href="/scenario/costs/specs_transport/efficiencies">
        'Costs & efficiencies'</a> section it is possible to make
        assumptions about future effiency improvements for transport vehicles.

      description: "Our mobility has grown as a result of a growing economy. Will
        this trend continue in the future? The growth rate that you indicate here
        determines the future demand for 'passenger kilometres', the total number
        of kilometres people travel per year. This number includes all passenger transport
        applications (car, bus, bike, etc.) and is not influenced by the population
        size. \r\n<br /> <br />\r\nBesides the growth rate, you can choose the division
        of transport applications here. What percentage of the kilometres we travel
        is covered by cars, buses, bikes, etc.?\r\n\r\n<br /> <br />\r\nPlease note
        that international aviation is part of the <a href=\"/scenario/demand/transport_international_transport/international-transport\">international
        transport section</a>."

        Which train technologies will be mostly used? Electric trains are
        cleaner and more efficient than diesel or coal-powered ones, but require more
        infrastructure to run. In the <a href="/scenario/demand/transport_fuels/rail-transport"
        >train fuels section</a> you can determine which fuels diesel trains will
        use.
