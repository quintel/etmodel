      title: Overview
      short_description:
      description: |
        The ETM automatically calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted as a result of energy use.
        Apart from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also other sources which lead to the emission of greenhouse
        gases (GHG). These ‘other emissions’ can be separated into 5 groups:
        <ul><li> Other greenhouse gas emissions which are emitted as a result of energy use, such as methane
        (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) </li>
        <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of non-energetic activities, such as the use of feedstock in industry
        or the production of cement</li>
        <li>Other greenhouse gas emissions from non-energetic activities, such as methane emissions from manure
        in agriculture</li>
        <li>Indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which are emitted due to the atmospheric oxidation
        of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC) in 
        different sectors</li>
        <li>Delayed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which arise from the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> for 'Other utilisation'
        </li></ul>
        <br/>
        In this section these ‘other’ greenhouse gas emissions and non-energetic emissions are displayed.
        Per sector you can view the amount of other greenhouse gas emissions are emitted as a result of energy use
        (‘energetic other GHG’), how many non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are emitted and how many
        non-energetic other greenhouse gases. Finally, you can adjust the indirect and delayed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <br/><br/>

      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of agricultural activities?
      These can be due to methane emissions from livestock (‘fermentation’), the use of manure or soil cultivation.
      Below you can specify assumptions regarding the future increase or decrease of non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub>
      or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."

      title: Industry and Energy
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of industrial activities
      and energy production in the energy sector? These can be emitted during industrial processes
      (primarily CO<sub>2</sub>), as a result of waste dumping (mainly methane) or during the production of
      electricity and heat (methane and nitrous oxide). Below you can specify assumptions regarding the
      future increase or decrease of these non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).

    other_emissions_indirect:
      title: Indirect emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        How much indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are emitted in the future? ‘Indirect emissions’ are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused
        by the atmospheric oxidation of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC).
        These substances are often released during non-energetic processes such as the storage of manure, chemical processes or use of solvents.
        Due to the large number of causes, indirect emissions can originate in any sector (agriculture, industry, the built environment or other sectors).
        Below you can specify whether these indirect emissions will decrease or increase in the future.
    other_emissions_delayed:
      title: Delayed emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        Delayed emissions arise from 'Other utilisation' of CO<sub>2</sub> in the 
        <a href="/scenario/emissions/ccus/utilisation-and-storage-of-co2">CCUS section</a>. Examples of
        'Other utilisation' include the use of CO<sub>2</sub> as a propellant gas for beer and soda, for 
        the production of the fertilizer urea or for the cultivation of crops in greenhouses. In the 
        future, captured CO<sub>2</sub> may even be used to produce plastics. </br></br>
        For most of the examples above, the CO<sub>2</sub> is only stored for a short time: when 
        soda or beer is consumed, the CO<sub>2</sub> is released. The resulting emissions of this 
        type of 'Other utilisation' are therefore defined as 'delayed emissions'. By default, all 
        delayed emissions are assumed to be take place within the same year as they are captured and 
        therefore count towards the total emissions in your scenario. </br></br>
        For some of the examples above, like the production of plastics, the captured CO<sub>2</sub> 
        can actually be stored for a very long time. These emissions are assumed to be 'delayed indefinitely' 
        and are therefore excluded from the total emissions. You can determine which share of 
        delayed emissions is delayed indefinitely with the sliders below.

        Below, you can set the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with imported heat.
    emissions_emission_factors_hydrogen_co2_import:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of imported hydrogen carriers and ammmonia
      short_description:
      description: |
        In some scenarios hydrogen carriers and/or ammonia will be imported from outside your
        region. This depends on how much you choose to produce locally in the
        <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production\">Hydrogen production</a>
        and <a href=\"/scenario/supply/hydrogen/ammonia-production\">Ammonia production</a>
        tabs. The production and distribution of imported hydrogen could have caused
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions elsewhere. How much of these emissions do you want
        to attribute to your region?
        <br/><br/>
        As a default, the emissions (in kg CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh hydrogen) are set equal to 
        the emissions of hydrogen produced with Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), since over 90% 
        of hydrogen produced today comes from SMR. However, you can change the emissions 
        yourself below. Click on the '?' for some reference values.
        <br/><br/>
        Shipping of liquified green ammonia (and then reforming it to hydrogen) is seen as
        a more practical option for importing large amounts of green hydrogen than transporting
        the hydrogen directly. By default, the emissions of imported ammonia are set equal to the
        emissions of ammonia produced using steam methane reforming, because this currently is the
        dominant production route. If you expect to import mostly green ammonia, you can change the
        emissions yourself below.
        <br/><br/>
        The costs related to this imported hydrogen can be set in the
        <a href=/scenario/costs/costs_hydrogen/ammonia-import> section.
