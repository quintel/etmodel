      title: Overview
      short_description:
      description: "The ETM calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted as a result of energy use.
      Apart from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also other sources which lead to the emission of greenhouse
      gases (GHG). These ‘other emissions’ can be separated into 3 groups:
      <ul><li> Other greenhouse gas emissions which are emitted as a result of energy use, such as methane
      (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) </li>
      <li>CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of non-energetic activities, such as the use of raw materials in industry
      or the production of cement</li>
      <li>Other greenhouse gas emissions from non-energetic activities, such as methane emissions from manure
      in agriculture</li></ul>
      <br />In this section these ‘other’ greenhouse gas emissions and non-energetic emissions are displayed.
      Per sector you can view the amount of other greenhouse gas emissions are emitted as a result of energy use
      (‘energetic other GHG’), how many non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are emitted and how many
      non-energetic other greenhouse gases.<br /><br />
      With sliders you can adjust how these emissions will change in the future. You can find more information in
      our documentation (LINK)."
    other_emissions_agriculture:
      title: Agriculture
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of agricultural activities?
      These can be due to methane emissions from livestock (‘fermentation’), the use of manure or soil cultivation.
      Below you can specify assumptions regarding the future increase or decrease of non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub>
      or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."
    other_emissions_industry:
      title: Industry and Energy
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of industrial activities
      and energy production in the energy sector? These can be emitted during industrial processes
      (primarily CO<sub>2</sub>), as a result of waste dumping (mainly methane) or during the production of
      electricity and heat (methane and nitrous oxide). Below you can specify assumptions regarding the
      future increase or decrease of these non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).
      <br /><br /> The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."
    other_emissions_built_environment:
      title: Built Environment
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future in the built environment? These are
      mainly methane emissions released during the production of heat. Below you can specify whether these
      emissions from households and buildings will decrease or increase in the future. <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."
    other_emissions_transport:
      title: Transport
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future in the transport sector? These are
      mainly methane and nitrous oxide emissions in exhaust gases. Below you can specify whether these
      emissions from households and buildings will decrease or increase in the future. <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."
    other_emissions_indirect:
      title: Indirect emissions
      short_description:
      description: "How much indirect emissions are emitted in the future? ‘Indirect emissions’ are a
      collection of emissions caused by the oxidation of Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC).
      These emissions have a large number of causes and can be emitted by any sector. Below you can specify
      whether these indirect emissions will decrease or increase in the future. <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the total indirect emissions now and in the future."
