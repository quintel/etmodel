      title: Overview

      description: |
        The ETM automatically calculates the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted as a result of energy use.
        Apart from CO<sub>2</sub> emissions there are also other sources which lead to the emission of greenhouse
        gases (GHG). These ‘other emissions’ can be separated into 5 groups:
        <ul><li> Other greenhouse gas emissions which are emitted as a result of energy use, such as methane
        (CH<sub>4</sub>) or nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) </li>
        <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of non-energetic activities, such as the use of feedstock in industry
        or the production of cement</li>
        <li>Other greenhouse gas emissions from non-energetic activities, such as methane emissions from manure
        in agriculture</li>
        <li>Indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which are emitted due to the atmospheric oxidation
        of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC) in 
        different sectors</li>
        <li>Delayed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions which arise from the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> for 'Other utilisation'
        </li></ul>
        <br/>
        In this section these ‘other’ greenhouse gas emissions and non-energetic emissions are displayed.
        Per sector you can view the amount of other greenhouse gas emissions are emitted as a result of energy use
        (‘energetic other GHG’), how many non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are emitted and how many
        non-energetic other greenhouse gases. Finally, you can adjust the indirect and delayed CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. <br/><br/>

      title: Agriculture
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of agricultural activities?
      These can be due to methane emissions from livestock (‘fermentation’), the use of manure or soil cultivation.
      Below you can specify assumptions regarding the future increase or decrease of non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub>
      or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."

      title: Industry and Energy
      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future as a result of industrial activities
      and energy production in the energy sector? These can be emitted during industrial processes
      (primarily CO<sub>2</sub>), as a result of waste dumping (mainly methane) or during the production of
      electricity and heat (methane and nitrous oxide). Below you can specify assumptions regarding the
      future increase or decrease of these non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> or other greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).
      <br /><br /> The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."

      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future in the built environment? These are
      mainly methane emissions released during the production of heat. Below you can specify whether these
      emissions from households and buildings will decrease or increase in the future. <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."

      short_description:
      description: "How much ‘other’ emissions are emitted in the future in the transport sector? These are
      mainly methane and nitrous oxide emissions in exhaust gases. Below you can specify whether these
      emissions from households and buildings will decrease or increase in the future. <br /><br />
      The figure on the right shows you the different sources of emissions now and in the future."
    other_emissions_indirect:
      title: Indirect emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        How much indirect CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are emitted in the future? ‘Indirect emissions’ are CO<sub>2</sub> emissions caused
        by the atmospheric oxidation of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC).
        These substances are often released during non-energetic processes such as the storage of manure, chemical processes or use of solvents.
        Due to the large number of causes, indirect emissions can originate in any sector (agriculture, industry, the built environment or other sectors).
        Below you can specify whether these indirect emissions will decrease or increase in the future.
    other_emissions_delayed:
      title: Delayed emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/emissions/ccus/utilisation-and-storage-of-co2">CCUS section</a> you can capture 
        CO<sub>2</sub> for 'Other utilisation'. This encompasses all utilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> that is not modelled separately 
        in the ETM. Examples include utilisation of CO<sub>2</sub> as a propellant gas for beer and soda or for the cultivation of crops in greenhouses. 
        In many cases, utilising CO2 does not reduce emission but only delays it. By default, all delayed emissions are assumed to be emitted in the same year, which 
        means that they count towards the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in your scenario. </br></br>
        It is however also possible to delay emissions indefinitely, for example when the captured CO<sub>2</sub> is 
        used to produce plastics. These emissions do not count towards the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With the 
        sliders below you can determine which share of the captured 'Other utilisaton' CO<sub>2</sub> is delayed indefinitely.
