      title: Electricity interconnectors
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <strong>domestic electricity market</strong> in your scenario is
        connected to one or more <strong>external markets</strong> via
        interconnectors. These interconnectors allow for importing and exporting
        electricity. </br></br>
        Import occurs whenever doing so is cheaper than using domestic
        electricity generation options. Similarly, electricity is exported whenever the
        neighbouring countries are willing to pay more than the domestic
        (production) price. </br></br>
        In the tabs below you can determine the capacity of interconnectors in
        your scenario, as well as a number of other attributes.
    flexibility_electricity_import_export_interconnectivity:
      title: Interconnector 1
      short_description:
      description:
        Many countries import and export electricity with their neighboring countries through different
        interconnectors. In the ETM it is possible to model up to twelve different electrical interconnectors
        between countries. You add an interconnector by setting interconnection capacity for that
        interconnector. If you prefer to model all interconnectors together, you only set interconnector
        capacity for interconnector 1. <br/><br/>
        You can set the capacity per interconnector. However, not all of this capacity may be available for
        export, for example because the neighboring country suffers from electricity surpluses at the same
        time. It is therefore possible to limit the percentage of interconnection capacity available for
        export. In addition to capacity, it is also possible to set the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions and price. The price determines the deployment order of interconnectors for import and
        export.

      description: "The energy transition affects the electricity network. In the
        table on the right you can see the peak load and usable capacity for the different
        grid levels. When you click on the 'Annual'-toggle in the top bar, you will
        be directed to the hourly chart that shows the net load on all electricity

    flexibility_flexibility_demand_response_hhp:
      title: Demand response - behavior of hybrid heat pumps
      short_description:
      description: |
        The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) depends on the
        ambient temperature and is represented by the coefficient of performance (COP).
        The COP becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. Below you can
        set the so-called 'threshold COP': if the COP of the heat pump falls below this
        threshold then the HHP switches from electricity to a backup fuel. This can be network gas, hydrogen or oil.
        You can choose a setting that is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can
        also choose a setting that produces less impact on the electricity network.
        See the <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/heat-pumps" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>
        for more information on the threshold COP.

    flexibility_flexibility_demand_response_load_shifting:
      title: Demand response - load shifting in industry
      short_description:
      description: |
        Demand response is a form of flexibility where energy demand is adjusted or shifted in time.
        One type of demand response is load shifting. With the sliders in this section you can implement
        load shifting for the electricity demand of the industrial sectors
        metal, chemical, central ICT and other industry. </br></br>
        If you install load shifting capacity for sector, it will use that capacity to decrease part of its electricity
        consumption when the electricity price is too high. The reduced consumption is caught up when the price
        drops. This means that the total electricity consumption over the year stays the same. </br></br>
        The aim is to avoid high electricity costs for industry, while at the same time decreasing demand
        peaks on the electricity network. This could decrease the need for peak power plants in your scenario.

      description: |
        Here you can set the capacity of the battery and the grid connection of wind turbines with an integrated battery system. For
        these sliders to be effective you therefore need to have these types of turbines
        installed. You can do this in the Supply section, under

    flexibility_power_storage_forecast_order:
      title: Forecasting storage order
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/behaviour-of-storage-technologies">
        Electricity storage</a> section, you can choose to use a
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/battery-forecasting/" target=\"_blank\">
        forecasting algorithm</a> to determine the behaviour of electricity storage technologies.
        Below you can change the merit order of storage technologies
        for which the system forecasting algorithm is enabled. </br></br>
        The first technology in this merit order will try to flatten the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/residual-load-curves">residual load curve</a>.
        Each following technology will then use the resulting curve of the previous technology to try and
        flatten it even further. </br></br>
        Technologies higher in the merit order will typically apply their forecasting algorithm
        to more variable curves. Whether a technology is suitable to deal with high variability depends on
        its specifications. The table on the right gives an overview of these specifications.
    flexibility_flexibility_power_to_heat:
      title: Conversion to heat for households
    flexibility_electricity_storage_overview:
      title: Behaviour of storage technologies
      short_description:
      description: |
        In this section you can determine the behaviour of electricity storage technologies such as batteries. These technologies
        are considered flexible, because both their supply and demand can be increased, reduced or shifted in
        time if needed (see the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility">
        Flexibility overview</a> for background information). </br></br> The ETM models three types of storage behaviour.
        <br /><ol><li>By default, storage behaves like any other flexible technology. Each storage technology has a
        <i>willingness to pay</i> that indicates the maximum electricity price for which it is willing to charge electricity.
        If the electricity price in a given hour is lower than a technology's willingness to pay, the storage technology will charge. </br></br>
        Similarly, each technology also has a <i>willingness to accept</i>, which indicates the minimum
        electricity price for which it is willing to discharge the stored electricity. This
        is similar to the concept of 'marginal costs' for flexible power plants.</li> </br>
        <li>Optionally you can choose to activate a
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/battery-forecasting/" target=\"_blank\">
        forecasting algorithm</a> that tries to improve the
        charging and discharging behaviour of storage. Rather than looking at the electricity
        price in the current hour only, the battery will look ahead in time to identify interesting moments
        for charging and discharging. It does so by looking at peaks and troughs in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/residual-load-curves">
        residual load curve</a>.</li> </br>
        <li>Finally, storage systems that are integrated with wind turbines or solar plants only store electricity
        when the production of the connected renewable energy source exceeds the connection capacity to the grid.
        They release their electricity when the production drops below that capacity. The storage system itself has
        no further interaction with the rest of the electricity system.</li></ol><br/>
        In the slides below you can set the the installed capacity for various electricity storage technologies and
        determine their behaviour. Note that the specific behaviour of these
        technologies is more complicated than stated in this short description. Our
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/electricity-storage" target=\"_blank\"> documentation</a>
        contains more details.<br/><br/>

        This chart</a> shows the installed volume of electricity storage technologies in comparison to storage volumes for other
        energy carriers.
    flexibility_power_storage_households_flexibility_p2p_electricity:
      title: Batteries in households
      short_description:
      description: |
        It is possible to install batteries in households. By default, if the electricity price is lower than the willingness
        to pay of the battery in a given hour, it will charge electricity in that hour. If the electricity price exceeds the
        willingness to accept, it will discharge the stored electricity. <br/><br/>
        Optionally, you can override this behaviour by switching to a
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/battery-forecasting" target=\"_blank\">
        forecasting algorithm</a>. Two types of forecasting are available for household batteries. The first type uses
        them to balance the electricity system as a whole, while the second type aims to balance local household demand with
        local production from solar PV. In
        <a href="#" class="open_chart" data-chart-key="flexibility_hourly_carriers_inflexible_imbalance" data-chart-location="side">

      title: Batteries in electric vehicles
      short_description:
      description: |
        Electric vehicles are often plugged into the grid for more hours than it takes to fully recharge
        their batteries. During those idle hours, it can be cost-effective to utilize the batteries to provide
        storage services for the electricity grid. </br></br>
        Batteries in the ETM are flexible technologies, which
        means that they can choose at which moments to charge or discharge. By default, if the electricity price is lower than the willingness to pay of the battery in a given hour, it
        will charge electricity in that hour. If the electricity price exceeds the willingness to accept, it will
        discharge the stored electricity. <br/><br/>Optionally, you can override this behaviour by switching the toggle below and use a forecasting algorithm to determine battery behaviour. In both cases the ETM respects the storage volume limits of the battery.

      short_description:
      description: |
        Pumped storage provides a cheap way for large-scale storage of electricity. Electricity can
        be used to pump water from the lower reservoir to a higher reservoir. Electricity is then
        produced by releasing the stored water through a turbine. </br></br>

        Underground pumped hydro storage (UPHS) allows for large-scale storage of electricity. It uses the

    flexibility_electricity_conversion_overview:
      title: Behaviour of conversion technologies
      short_description:
      description: |
        In this section you can determine the behaviour of different types of flexible demand technologies
        for electricity conversion. The demand of these technologies
        is considered flexible because it can be increased, reduced or shifted in time if needed (see the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility"> Flexibility overview </a>
        for background information). </br></br>
        Each flexible demand technology has a <i>willingness to pay</i> that indicates the maximum
        electricity price for which it is willing to consume electricity. If the electricity price
        in a given hour is lower than a technology's willingness to pay, the technology will consume
        electricity in that hour.
        In the slides below you can set the willingness to pay and installed capacity for:

    flexibility_flexibility_power_to_heat_for_district_heating:
      title: Conversion to heat for district heating
      short_description:
      description: |
        Electricity can be used to produce heat through electric boilers or heat pumps, which is
        also known as power-to-heat. In the ETM, power-to-heat is a flexible demand technology, which
        means that heat is only produced when the willingness to pay of power-to-heat exceeds the hourly
        electricity price. See our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/electricity-conversion" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> for more information. </br></br>
        Note that a 1 MWth power-to-heat boiler uses more electricity than a 1 MWth power-to-heat heat
        pump, even though they produce the same amount of heat per hour. The produced heat is delivered
        to the district heating network. You can then determine whether it supplies medium or high temperature
        heat in the <a href="/scenario/supply/heat/allocation-of-power-to-heat">District heating</a> section.

        Gas and hydrogen burners in industry can be turned into hybrid heaters by fitting
        them with an electric boiler. In the ETM, this power-to-heat boiler is a flexible demand
        technology, which means that when the willingness to pay exceeds the hourly electricity
        price, the power-to-heat boilers will produce the required heat instead of the gas or
        hydrogen burners. See our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/electricity-conversion" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a> for more information. </br></br>
        Because it is a hybrid heating option it requires capacity of both power-to-heat
        boilers and gas or hydrogen burners to be installed for it to have an effect.

    flexibility_overview_introduction:
      title: What is flexibility?
      short_description:
      description: |
        Natural patterns like seasons (yearly), the variations in weather (weekly), day and night
        and our rhythm of waking up, going to work, coming home, etc. cause both the need for energy
        and the availability of energy to fluctuate. Flexibility is about balancing energy supply
        and demand on all these timescales. </br></br>
        For longer timescales, the amount or volume of energy supplied or used is more interesting.
        For shorter timescales, the ability to produce or use a certain amount of energy is more
        interesting. This is called capacity.
        Some flexibility technologies are more suited to process large (fluctuations in) volumes of
        energy, others are more suitable for large fluctuations in capacity, and some are suited to both.
        Some examples are: </br>
        <ul> <i>Suitable for large (fluctuations in) volume </i>
        <ul><li> Import/export of gas/hydrogen </li>
        <li> Power-to-gas: hydrogen production from electricity </li>
        <li> Storage of gas/hydrogen </li>
        <li> Seasonal storage of heat </li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Suitable for large or sudden (fluctuations in) capacity </i>
        <ul><li> Storage in lithium-ion batteries </li>
        <li> Dispatchable power and heat plants </li>
        <li> Demand side response </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Suitable for both volume and capacity </i>
        <ul><li> Import/export of electricity </li>
        <li> Power-to-heat: heat production from electricity (with heat storage) </li>
        <li> Curtailment of renewable electricity production </li>
        <li> Large-scale electricity storage: pumped hydro storage </li>
        </ul> </ul> </br>
        In this section, you can see how supply and demand (mis)match on various timescales, how this
        results in the need for flexibility in the energy system and how you can provide this need. In
        the next slide we will go deeper into the definitions of imbalance and flexibility.
    flexibility_overview_hourly_electricity_supply_demand:
      title: Hourly inflexible supply and demand
      short_description:
      description: |
        What do we actually mean when we talk about the mismatch or imbalance between supply and demand?
        To help us understand these concepts better we begin by defining two types of supply: </br>
        <ul><li> Inflexible supply: this is the energy produced by technologies that cannot be regulated
        easily by humans or that run continuously based on cost considerations. Wind and solar are good
        examples of technologies that cannot be regulated by humans. They do show variable behaviour
        (volatile changes due to environmental effects) but they for instance do not follow hourly
        electricity prices. We therefore call them inflexible. Nuclear power plants are an example of
        power plants that can be adjusted to run continuously based on cost considerations. These kind of
        plants are called must-run. </li>
        <li> Flexible supply: this energy production typically <i>does</i> follow man-made rules (such as hourly
        electricity prices) and includes so-called <i>dispatchable</i> plants like gas-fired power plants. </li>
        </ul></br>
        ... and two types of demand:
        <ul><li> Inflexible (or <i>baseload</i>) demand: this type of energy consumption is considered fixed
        because it cannot be regulated easily. This for example includes industrial processes that need
        to run continuously, or consumption that does not respond to hourly electricity prices such as
        individual households. Most of the final electricity demand of sectors falls into this category. </li>
        <li> Flexible demand: this is energy consumption that can be increased, reduced, or shifted in
        time if needed. </li>
        </ul></br>
        In the chart to the right, we only show the inflexible supply and demand of electricity. For other
        energy carriers you can find a similar chart in the chart list (upper right corner). </br></br>
        It should be noted that changes in flexible technologies can, indirectly, lead to changes in the
        inflexible supply and demand. For example, the installation of power-to-gas, which is a flexible
        technology, can reduce the need for hydrogen import, which is inflexible, causing the inflexible
        supply of hydrogen to change. These second-order effects can lead to interesting behaviour of the
        inflexible supply and demand curves. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and
        baseload demand can be found in our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>. </br></br>
        In the next section we take the exploration of inflexible supply and demand a step further by
        looking at how they behave on a timescale longer than hours.
    flexibility_overview_inflexible_demand_supply_sum:
      title: Monthly inflexible supply and demand volumes
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly total volumes for supply and demand of electricity, network gas,
        hydrogen and heat for district heating. This shows you how these carriers typically vary throughout
        the year: when are they mainly consumed? When are the moments of extra production? </br></br>
        As with the hourly curves in the previous slide, only the inflexible supply and the baseload demand
        are shown in this chart. This allows you to clearly see the natural variations in the energy system.
        </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or
        hide. If you want a more detailed view, you can also zoom in on an energy carrier by clicking on that
        carrier in a specific month. This will open a new chart showing the hourly values for that carrier in
        the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_inflexible_demand_supply_max:
      title: "The need for flexibility: capacity"
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly maximum <i>capacity</i> for supply and demand of electricity,
        network gas, hydrogen and heat for district heating. This gives an indication of the capacity needed to deal
        with imbalance for each energy carrier. This capacity can be realized in the form of transport
        infrastructure or other flexibility options. For the electricity network the relation between
        transport infrastructure and flexibility options can be explored in more detail in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_net_load/peak-load-and-usable-capacity">Net load</a> section. </br></br>
        As with the above charts that focus on volume, only the inflexible supply and the baseload
        demand are shown. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and baseload
        demand can be found in our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>. </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or hide.
        If you want to view when peaks occur within a month, you can also zoom in on an energy carrier by clicking
        on that carrier in a specific month. This will open a new chart showing the hourly values for that
        carrier in the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_timescales_imbalance:
      title: "The need for flexibility: timescales"
      short_description:
      description: |
        This table takes the concepts learned in the previous sections a step further by analyzing
        the need for flexibility on different timescales for network gas and hydrogen. It shows the
        need for flexible capacity and flexible volume for both supply and demand. </br></br>
        The basis of the analysis is the <i>original imbalance</i> (the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/residual-load-curves">residual load curve</a>),
        which is shown first. The curve is then split into two timescales by applying a moving average. You
        can set the period of the moving average with the slider below.
        <ul>
        <li> The <i>short timescale</i> is given by the difference between the original residual
        load curve and the moving average, and is typically very variable. </li>
        <li>The <i>long timescale</i> is given by the moving average, and is typically much more
        smooth. </li>
        </ul> </br>
        For network gas and hydrogen, flexibility is provided by storage in the ETM. Large-scale storage
        volumes for these carriers are typically realized underground. Two viable types of underground
        storage are salt caverns and empty gas fields. Salt caverns are better suited to deliver short-term
        flexibility, while empty gas fields can handle long-term flexibility better. There will be
        geographical limitations to the potential of both types of storage in your area.
        The table can help you assess whether your scenario falls within these limitations.
    flexibility_overview_flexible_capacities:
      title: "The provision of flexibility: capacity"
      short_description:
      description: |
        As we have seen in previous sections, imbalance in the supply and demand of carriers occurs when we integrate
        large volumes of volatile energy in our energy system while keeping the demand fixed. Whenever the volatile
        and must-run (inflexible) supply is larger than the baseload (inflexible) demand, the energy system can be
        said to have an ‘excess’ of energy. Flexible demand technologies can be used to utilize this energy excess.
        In moments where the reverse happens, flexible supply technologies can be used to meet the energy shortage.
        </br></br>
        So far, the charts shown in this section have focused on the need for flexibility. This chart focuses on the
        provision of flexibility. More precisely: the installed capacity of flexible supply and demand technologies
        for electricity, network gas, hydrogen and heat for district heating are shown. Additionally, it shows the
        maximum excess and shortage for each energy carrier. This indicates whether you have installed enough flexible
        technologies to fully utilize the excesses and to fully meet the shortage. </br></br>
        Note that, for electricity, flexible supply technologies may also produce for flexible demand
        technologies. You can for example use electricity from batteries to produce hydrogen through power-to-gas.
        This means that it is not necessarily inefficient to have more capacity installed than the maximum excess or
        shortage. Also note that for the gaseous carriers the system is automatically balanced by storage. This means
        that the storage capacity will align with the maximum excess and shortage by default.
    flexibility_overview_hourly_carriers_inflexible_imbalance:
      title: Residual load curves
      short_description:
      description: |
        In previous slides we looked at the natural variations of (inflexible) supply and demand of energy for
        the various carriers. To show the ‘need for flexibility’ more clearly, we subtract the inflexible supply
        from the baseload demand and plot the resulting difference. This is called the ‘residual load curve’
        which shows for every hour whether the difference between (inflexible) supply and demand is a ‘residual
        demand’ or a ‘residual supply’. Other words that are commonly used to describe residual demand and supply
        are ‘shortage’ and ‘surplus’ or ‘excess’ of energy. </br></br>
        In other words: the residual load curve shows the hourly <i>imbalance</i> of energy carriers which would occur
        if we would not make an effort to balance the energy system. </br></br>
        Please take a close look at what the signs of the residual load curve actually mean. Because the inflexible
        supply is subtracted from the baseload demand, negative values mean ‘surpluses’ of energy and positive
        values ‘shortages’. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and baseload demand can be
        found in our documentation. </br></br>
        In the next slide we will take a closer look at the residual load on longer timescales.
    flexibility_overview_monthly_carriers_inflexible_imbalance:
      title: Imbalance of monthly supply and demand volumes
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly imbalance between supply and demand volumes for electricity, network gas,
        hydrogen and heat for district heating. This gives you insight into the balance of your energy system
        throughout the year: in which months does an imbalance occur? Which carriers are not in balance? Are
        these shortages or surpluses of energy? </br></br>
        The imbalance is calculated by subtracting the inflexible supply from the baseload demand, this is
        called the "residual load". In comparison with the hourly residual load curve shown on the previous
        slide, this chart allows you to see the imbalance on a longer timescale. </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or hide.
        If you want a more detailed view, you can also zoom in by clicking on a specific month. This will open a
        new chart showing the residual load curves for the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_cumulative_imbalance:
      title: "The need for flexibility: volume"
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart gives a rough estimate for how much long-term flexibility (storage volume)
        is needed in your scenario. The blue (“uncorrected”) line in the chart is created by
        summing up the hourly imbalance for all relevant carriers at each hour. Subsequently, the line
        has been moved upwards, to only show positive values. This line is
        indicative because we do not take any losses of storage or conversion into account. </br></br>
        This line gives a general impression of the extent to which the energy system is in
        balance over the year. In periods where demand exceeds supply (cold periods with no
        wind and little sunshine), the resulting line dips as ‘storage’ gets depleted. In
        periods where supply is generally higher than demand (like sunny summer months), the
        line rises again. Note that here a different convention is used for the meaning of negative
        and positive values than in the chart "Imbalance of monthly supply and demand volumes". </br></br>
        By comparing the start and end point of this line, you can see whether the system is
        in surplus or deficit on an annual basis. The absolute difference shows how much room
        there is for surplus storage or surplus conversion losses to make up for any shortages,
        or how large the shortage is that needs to be filled with additional energy production
        or imports. </br></br>
        The red (“corrected”) line shows the fluctuations in required storage volume if supply
        and demand would balance out over the year. This gives a rough estimate of your total
        required storage capacity to ensure that carriers can be used at the right time. This
        total required storage capacity can be read from the highest value of this line. </br></br>
        This line is obtained by subtracting the annual surplus/deficit from the blue line.
        Because the cumulative nature of the line, the correction of first hour is added to
        the correction of the second hour etc. until the last hour is corrected to coincide
        with the level of the first hour.

        Batteries and other forms of storage have fast reaction times but require

        Dispatchable power plants can supply power at any time but some of them require

        can be switched on during demand peaks. If none of these sources can supply

    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order:
      title: Merit order
      short_description:
      description: |
        Generally speaking, electricity generation follows electricity
        demand. The order in which power plants are dispatched is determined by the
        merit order. The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal
        costs. Those with the lowest marginal costs are dispatched first to meet demand;
        those with higher costs only when demand is high enough. Power plants with
        low operating costs therefore have a high number of operating hours while
        expensive ones may operate as little as a few hundred hours per year. This
        can play a large role in the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your scenario.
        </br></br>
        The merit order calculation in the ETM is simplified as it does not distinguish or rank
        individual plants, but only <strong>types</strong> of plants. For more information, see the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order"

    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order_positions:
      title: Merit order positions
      short_description:
      description: |
        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs. Not
        all electricity production technologies participate in the merit order.
        Renewable power from wind and solar has priority, for example, and so
        increasing the share of such technologies in your scenario will decrease
        the operating hours of the remaining plants. Since the merit order is
        determined solely by marginal costs, it is possible that more efficient
        technologies are 'pushed' out of the electricity generation mix this way. <br/><br/>
        Furthermore, certain technologies are considered 'must-run'. These are
        mainly CHPs that satisfy a certain heat demand and do not primarily run to
        sell power. These must-runplants are therefore not included in the merit
        order. They do influence the operating hours of other plants of course. <br/><br/>
        The ETM calculates which power plants are dispatched at each hour in the
        year. The results are updated every time you make changes to your scenario
        and communicated through various charts. You can download the resulting
        hourly load curves for each type of power plant as well as the power price

        Note: Selecting a weather year other than Default will overwrite previous assumptions
        about changes in full load hours and temperature. The description of the weather years
        below contains the corresponding full load hours and temperature.<br/><br/>

        In this section, custom hourly profiles can be uploaded in CSV format to overwrite the default profiles used
        in the ETM. Note that the uploaded custom profiles are scenario inputs; based on these profiles,
        the model calculates the resulting (hourly) flows.<br/><br/>
        Different types of profiles are distinguished. By selecting a category below, details of the relevant profile type
        and file requirements are provided. Uploaded curves can also be downloaded again, they will be obtained in the
        same format as uploaded. More information can be found in the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/curves#modifying-profiles"
        target =\"_blank\">documentation</a>.<br/><br/>
        Based on annual flows and the uploaded hourly supply or demand profiles, the model calculates the resulting
        hourly flows as scenario output. The resulting profiles that represent the hourly energy flows are
        depicted in the chart on the right per supply and demand category. The output profiles can also
        be downloaded in the <a href="/scenario/data/data_export/overview">Data export</a>
        section.
