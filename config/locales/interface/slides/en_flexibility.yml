      title: Electricity interconnectors
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <strong>domestic electricity market</strong> in your scenario is
        connected to one or more <strong>external markets</strong> via
        interconnectors. These interconnectors allow for importing and exporting
        electricity.</p>

        <p>Import occurs whenever doing so is cheaper than using domestic
        electricity generation options. By default, electricity is exported only
        when there is a surplus from
        <a
          href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order/#participants"
          target="_blank"
        >volatile and must-run sources</a>.</p>

        <p>In real-world markets, electricity may be exported whenever the
        production price is lower than that of the external market. Dispatchable
        plants can then also be used for export. Enabling this feature with the
        toggle below may significantly increase the amount of
        electricity generated in your scenario.

      title: Interconnector 1
      short_description:
      description: "The difference between supply and demand of electricity on an
      hourly basis can be imported or exported. Many countries import and export
      electricity with their neighboring countries through different interconnectors.
      In the ETM it is possible to model up to six different electrical interconnectors
      between countries. You add an interconnector by setting interconnection capacity
      for that interconnector. If you prefer to model all interconnectors together,
      you only set interconnector capacity for interconnector 1.
      \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n
      You can set the capacity per interconnector. However, not all of this capacity
      may be available for export, for example because the neighboring country suffers
      from electricity surpluses at the same time. It is therefore possible to limit
      the percentage of interconnection capacity available for export. In addition to capacity,
      it is also possible to set the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and price.
      The price determines the deployment order of interconnectors
      for import and export."

        grid levels. When you click on the 'Annual'-toggle in the top bar, you will
        be directed to the hourly chart that shows the net load on all electricity

      title: Demand response - electric vehicles
      short_description:
      description: "Demand response is a form of flexibility where energy demand is
        adjusted or shifted in time. The goal is to reduce peaks in energy demand.
        With the sliders in this section, you can adjust the charging behaviour of
        electric vehicles. The chart shows the impact this has on the shape of the

    flexibility_flexibility_demand_response_hhp:
      title: Demand response - behavior of hybrid heat pumps
      short_description:
      description: "The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) is dependent on the
        ambient temperature and is depicted by the coefficient of performance (COP).
        The COP becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. Below you can
        set the so-called 'threshold COP': if the COP of the heat pump is below this
        threshold then the HHP switches from electricity to gas. You can choose a
        setting that is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can
        also choose a setting that produces less impact on the electricity network.
        </br></br>
        To help you decide the cost-optimal threshold COP setting
        from a consumer perspective, have a look at the chart on the right. It shows
        how much it costs to make a unit of heat with the HHP for space heating. For
        the gas part, these costs are independent of the COP (and therefore the outside
        temperature). The costs for the electrical part are decreasing with increasing
        COP (and increasing outside temperature). The intersection of the two curves
        is the cost-optimal COP setting for the given cost price gas and electricity.
        This cost price of gas and electricity can be adjusted below. The start value
        of the treshold COP slider matches the calculated cost-optimal threshold COP
        for space heating.

      title: Order of flexibility options
      short_description:
      description: "Wind turbines and solar panels are subject to volatile natural
        patterns. The electricity that they produce might therefore not always be
        used to match demand directly and consequently lead to excess electricity.
        To prevent curtailment of excess electricity production, the ETM contains
        several flexibility technologies that can either store or convert the excess
        electricity. You can include these technologies in the <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/storage-in-household-batteries\">'Storage'</a>

      description: Excess electricity can be used to produce hydrogen in an electrolysis
        process. In the ETM, the hydrogen produced by using excess power will be fed
        into the central hydrogen network. In addition to this hydrogen producing
        technology, you can choose to produce hydrogen through other processes in
        <a href="/scenario/supply/hydrogen/hydrogen-production" >hydrogen production

      description: "If a lot of solar PV is installed, this can cause high peaks on
        the electricity network. It is therefore desirable to be able to curtail these
        peaks. In some cases it is smart to connect solar parks to only a certain
        percentage of the peak power. With the sliders below it is possible to set
        the curtailment as a percentage of the peak power. \r\n</br></br>\r\n In the

    flexibility_overview_introduction:
      title: What is flexibility?
      short_descriptioN:
      description: |
        Natural patterns like seasons (yearly), the variations in weather (weekly), day and night
        and our rhythm of waking up, going to work, coming home, etc. cause both the need for energy
        and the availability of energy to fluctuate. Flexibility is about balancing energy supply
        and demand on all these timescales. </br></br>
        For longer timescales, the amount or volume of energy supplied or used is more interesting.
        For shorter timescales, the ability to produce or use a certain amount of energy is more
        interesting. This is called capacity.
        Some flexibility technologies are more suited to process large (fluctuations in) volumes of
        energy, others are more suitable for large fluctuations in capacity, and some are suited to both.
        Some examples are: </br>
        <ul> <i>Suitable for large (fluctuations in) volume </i>
        <ul><li> Import/export of gas/hydrogen </li>
        <li> Power-to-gas: hydrogen production from excess electricity </li>
        <li> Storage of gas/hydrogen </li>
        <li> Seasonal storage of heat </li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Suitable for large or sudden (fluctuations in) capacity </i>
        <ul><li> Storage in lithium-ion batteries </li>
        <li> Dispatchable power and heat plants </li>
        <li> Demand side response </li>
        </ul>
        <i>Suitable for both volume and capacity </i>
        <ul><li> Import/export of electricity </li>
        <li> Power-to-heat: heat production from excess electricity (with heat storage) </li>
        <li> Curtailment of renewable electricity production </li>
        <li> Large-scale electricity storage: pumped hydro storage </li>
        </ul> </ul> </br>
        In this section, you can see how supply and demand (mis)match on various timescales, how this
        results in the need for flexibility in the energy system and how you can provide this need. In
        the next slide we will go deeper into the definitions of imbalance and flexibility.
    flexibility_overview_hourly_electricity_supply_demand:
      title: Hourly inflexible supply and demand
      short_description:
      description: |
        What do we actually mean when we talk about the mismatch or imbalance between supply and demand?
        To help us understand these concepts better we begin by defining two types of supply: </br>
        <ul><li> Inflexible supply: this is the energy produced by technologies that cannot be regulated
        easily by humans or that run continuously based on cost considerations. Wind and solar are good
        examples of technologies that cannot be regulated by humans. They do show variable behaviour
        (volatile changes due to environmental effects) but they for instance do not follow hourly
        electricity prices. We therefore call them inflexible. Nuclear power plants are an example of
        power plants that can be adjusted to run continuously based on cost considerations. These kind of
        plants are called must-run. </li>
        <li> Flexible supply: this energy production typically <i>does</i> follow man-made rules (such as hourly
        electricity prices) and includes so-called <i>dispatchable</i> plants like gas-fired power plants. </li>
        </ul></br>
        ... and two types of demand:
        <ul><li> Inflexible (or <i>baseload</i>) demand: this type of energy consumption is considered fixed
        because it cannot be regulated easily. This for example includes industrial processes that need
        to run continuously, or consumption that does not respond to hourly electricity prices such as
        individual households. Most of the final electricity demand of sectors falls into this category. </li>
        <li> Flexible demand: this is energy consumption that can be increased, reduced, or shifted in
        time if needed. </li>
        </ul></br>
        In the chart to the right, we only show the inflexible supply and demand of electricity. For other
        energy carriers you can find a similar chart in the chart list (upper right corner). </br></br>
        It should be noted that changes in flexible technologies can, indirectly, lead to changes in the
        inflexible supply and demand. For example, the installation of power-to-gas, which is a flexible
        technology, can reduce the need for hydrogen import, which is inflexible, causing the inflexible
        supply of hydrogen to change. These second-order effects can lead to interesting behaviour of the
        inflexible supply and demand curves. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and
        baseload demand can be found in our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>. </br></br>
        In the next section we take the exploration of inflexible supply and demand a step further by
        looking at how they behave on a timescale longer than hours.
    flexibility_overview_inflexible_demand_supply_sum:
      title: Monthly inflexible supply and demand volumes
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly total volumes for supply and demand of electricity, network gas,
        hydrogen and heat for district heating. This shows you how these carriers typically vary throughout
        the year: when are they mainly consumed? When are the moments of extra production? </br></br>
        As with the hourly curves in the previous slide, only the inflexible supply and the baseload demand
        are shown in this chart. This allows you to clearly see the natural variations in the energy system.
        </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or
        hide. If you want a more detailed view, you can also zoom in on an energy carrier by clicking on that
        carrier in a specific month. This will open a new chart showing the hourly values for that carrier in
        the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_inflexible_demand_supply_max:
      title: "The need for flexibility: capacity"
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly maximum <i>capacity</i> for supply and demand of electricity,
        network gas, hydrogen and heat for district heating. This gives an indication of the capacity needed to deal
        with imbalance for each energy carrier. This capacity can be realized in the form of transport
        infrastructure or other flexibility options. For the electricity network the relation between
        transport infrastructure and flexibility options can be explored in more detail in the
        <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_net_load/peak-load-and-usable-capacity">Net load</a> section. </br></br>
        As with the above charts that focus on volume, only the inflexible supply and the baseload
        demand are shown. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and baseload
        demand can be found in our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>. </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or hide.
        If you want to view when peaks occur within a month, you can also zoom in on an energy carrier by clicking
        on that carrier in a specific month. This will open a new chart showing the hourly values for that
        carrier in the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_flexible_capacities:
      title: "The provision of flexibility: capacity"
      short_description:
      description: |
        As we have seen in previous sections, imbalance in the supply and demand of carriers occurs when we integrate
        large volumes of volatile energy in our energy system while keeping the demand fixed. Whenever the volatile
        and must-run (inflexible) supply is larger than the baseload (inflexible) demand, the energy system can be
        said to have an ‘excess’ of energy. Flexible demand technologies can be used to utilize this energy excess.
        In moments where the reverse happens, flexible supply technologies can be used to meet the energy shortage.
        </br></br>
        So far, the charts shown in this section have focused on the need for flexibility. This chart focuses on the
        provision of flexibility. More precisely: the installed capacity of flexible supply and demand technologies
        for electricity, network gas, hydrogen and heat for district heating are shown. Additionally, it shows the
        maximum excess and shortage for each energy carrier. This indicates whether you have installed enough flexible
        technologies to fully utilize the excesses and to fully meet the shortage. You can tune the installed capacity
        of flexible technologies in your scenario, for example in the Excess electricity section. </br></br>
        Note that some technologies appear twice in this chart. Power-to-gas for instance occurs in the electricity
        column (as flexible demand) and in the hydrogen column (as flexible supply). This is a direct consequence of
        the chosen definition of flexible technologies in the ETM. More information about the definitions of flexible
        technologies can be found in our <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility#definitions-of-flexible-and-inflexible-supply-and-demand" target=\"_blank\">
        documentation</a>. </br></br>
        It is also worth to note that the methane- and hydrogen storage are not generally dimensioned to match the maximum
        shortage and excess. This has two reasons. Firstly, for the gaseous carriers, the storage is solely responsible
        for balancing. Secondly, in the case of  hydrogen, power-to-gas has a profile that typically follows volatile
        electricity supply rather than hydrogen demand. As noted above, power-to-gas is considered to be a flexible
        technology and, is therefore not included in the residual load curve. This means that it does not affect the
        maximum excess (blue line).
    flexibility_overview_hourly_carriers_inflexible_imbalance:
      title: Residual load curves
      short_description:
      description: |
        In previous slides we looked at the natural variations of (inflexible) supply and demand of energy for
        the various carriers. To show the ‘need for flexibility’ more clearly, we subtract the inflexible supply
        from the baseload demand and plot the resulting difference. This is called the ‘residual load curve’
        which shows for every hour whether the difference between (inflexible) supply and demand is a ‘residual
        demand’ or a ‘residual supply’. Other words that are commonly used to describe residual demand and supply
        are ‘shortage’ and ‘surplus’ or ‘excess’ of energy. </br></br>
        In other words: the residual load curve shows the hourly <i>imbalance</i> of energy carriers which would occur
        if we would not make an effort to balance the energy system. </br></br>
        Please take a close look at what the signs of the residual load curve actually mean. Because the inflexible
        supply is subtracted from the baseload demand, negative values mean ‘surpluses’ of energy and positive
        values ‘shortages’. More information about the definitions of inflexible supply and baseload demand can be
        found in our documentation. </br></br>
        In the next slide we will take a closer look at the residual load on longer timescales.
    flexibility_overview_monthly_carriers_inflexible_imbalance:
      title: Imbalance of monthly supply and demand volumes
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the monthly imbalance between supply and demand volumes for electricity, network gas,
        hydrogen and heat for district heating. This gives you insight into the balance of your energy system
        throughout the year: in which months does an imbalance occur? Which carriers are not in balance? Are
        these shortages or surpluses of energy? </br></br>
        The imbalance is calculated by subtracting the inflexible supply from the baseload demand, this is
        called the "residual load". In comparison with the hourly residual load curve shown on the previous
        slide, this chart allows you to see the imbalance on a longer timescale. </br></br>
        By clicking on the labels of the chart you can determine which energy carriers you want to show or hide.
        If you want a more detailed view, you can also zoom in by clicking on a specific month. This will open a
        new chart showing the residual load curves for the selected month.
    flexibility_overview_cumulative_imbalance:
      title: "The need for flexibility: volume"
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart gives a rough estimate for how much long-term flexibility (storage volume)
        is needed in your scenario. The blue (“uncorrected”) line in the chart is created by
        summing up the hourly imbalance for all relevant carriers at each hour. Subsequently, the line
        has been moved upwards, to only show positive values. This line is
        indicative because we do not take any losses of storage or conversion into account. </br></br>
        This line gives a general impression of the extent to which the energy system is in
        balance over the year. In periods where demand exceeds supply (cold periods with no
        wind and little sunshine), the resulting line dips as ‘storage’ gets depleted. In
        line where supply is generally higher than demand (like sunny summer months), the
        line rises again. Note that here a different convention is used for the meaning of negative
        and positive values than in the chart "Imbalance of monthly supply and demand volumes". </br></br>
        By comparing the start and end point of this line, you can see whether the system is
        in surplus or deficit on an annual basis. The absolute difference shows how much room
        there is for surplus storage or surplus conversion losses to make up for any shortages,
        or how large the shortage is that needs to be filled with additional energy production
        or imports. </br></br>
        The red (“corrected”) line shows the fluctuations in required storage volume if supply
        and demand would balance out over the year. This gives a rough estimate of your total
        required storage capacity to ensure that carriers can be used at the right time. This
        total required storage capacity can be read from the highest value of this line. </br></br>
        This line is obtained by subtracting the annual surplus/deficit from the blue line.

        at any moment? For example, is your scenario robust for extended periods of
        low wind and solar generation combined with demand peaks? Renewable power
        production presents challenges for the security of supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe
        chart to the right shows how reliable power supply is for every hour per year
        in your scenario. In the dashboard below you can see the number of (expected)
        blackout hours due to a lack of power supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nProduction
        technologies vary in their ability to supply electricity during demand peaks.
        Batteries and other forms of storage have fast reaction times but require
        charging and are less suited to bridge long gaps in solar and wind production.
        Dispatchable power plants can supply power at any time but some of them require
        many operating hours per year to cover their costs or are too expensive to
        turn on and off repeatedly.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n(Renewable) gas turbines and
        engines using green gas or hydrogen are promising technologies to provide
        back-up capacity for a future energy system relying on wind and solar power.
        This is due to their fast ramping speeds and relatively low investment costs.\r\n<br

        speeds and solar radiation impact your scenario. Is your scenario able to
        cope with extreme weather conditions? Will people be left in the dark during
        periods of very low wind and solar generation?"

      short_description:
      description: "Will the future supply of heat be sufficient during every hour
        per year to meet demand of district heating networks? This depends of course
        on the heat sources connected to the network. We distinguish between 'must-run'
        sources have a constant production of heat and 'dispatchable' sources that
        can be switched on during demand peaks. If none of these sources can supply
        sufficient heat, emergency supply is activated to prevent shortages.\r\n<br
        /><br />\r\n<b>Emergency supply</b><br />\r\nAn ideal back-up supply can be
        turned on quickly, has low installation and maintenance costs and uses a fuel
        that is easy to store or transport. For this reason, district heating networks
        often use gas burners as emergency supply in case (part of) the baseload heat
        sources fail. Smaller heating networks are typically connected to a smaller
        number of heat sources which increases the importance of a proper back-up
        system.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Peak demand</b><br />\r\nSome heat sources are
        better suited for supplying demand peaks than others. A heat buffer is able
        to respond quickly to changes in demand, but has to be big enough and needs
        to be filled first. A geothermal heat well is expensive and is therefore best
        used to produce heat non-stop. Burners using (green) gas or hydrogen can supply
        heat at any moment and are therefore a logical choice for meeting demand peaks.\r\n<br

      title: Merit order
      short_description:
      description: "Generally speaking, electricity generation follows electricity
        demand. The order in which power plants are dispatched is determined by the
        merit order. The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal
        costs. Those with the lowest marginal costs are dispatched first to meet demand;
        those with higher costs only when demand is high enough. Power plants with
        low operating costs therefore have a high number of operating hours while
        expensive ones may operate as little as a few hundred hours per year. This
        can play a large role in the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your scenario.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBy
        default the ETM calculates which power plants have to be dispatched for each
        hour in the year. This calculation is performed every time you make changes
        to your scenario. You can choose to switch the merit order calculation off;
        when switched off, all power plants will have the same full load hours in
        the future as in the present year of your scenario and these will not respond
        to your assumptions on fuel or other costs. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe merit order
        calculation in the ETM is simplified as it does not distinguish or rank individual
        plants, but only <strong>types</strong> of plants. For more information about
        the merit order calculation <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order\"

        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs. Not
        all electricity production technologies participate in the merit order.
        Renewable power from wind and solar has priority, for example, and so
        increasing the share of such technologies in your scenario will decrease
        the operating hours of the remaining plants. Since the merit order is
        determined solely by marginal costs, it is possible that more efficient
        technologies are 'pushed' out of the electricity generation mix this way

        <br/><br/>

        Furthermore, certain technologies are considered 'must-run'. These are
        mainly CHPs that satisfy a certain heat demand and do not primarily run to
        sell power. These must-runplants are therefore not included in the merit
        order. They do influence the operating hours of other plants of course.

        <br/><br/>

        The ETM calculates which power plants are dispatched at each hour in the
        year. The results areupdated every time you make changes to your scenario
        and communicated through various charts. You can download the resulting
        hourly load curves for each type of power plant as well as the power price
