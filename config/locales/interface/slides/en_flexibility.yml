      title: Towards a European 'Merit Order'
      short_description:
      description: "The so-called <strong>merit order</strong> (also see <a href=\"/scenario/costs/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>) determines the order in which producers of electricity meet
        demand. Producers with the lowest marginal costs have priority.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThis
        means that, in general, countries with cheaper electricity production will
        export to countries with more expensive production. They will do this until
        prices in both countries converge or the interconnectors work at maximum capacity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn
        order to achieve the coupling of electricity markets on a physical level,
        interconnections between countries are being increased and their utilization
        optimized. "

      title: Electricity interconnector 1
      short_description:
      description: "The difference between supply and demand of electricity on an
      hourly basis can be imported or exported. Many countries import and export
      electricity with their neighboring countries through different interconnectors.
      In the ETM it is possible to model up to six different electrical interconnectors
      between countries. You add an interconnector by setting interconnection capacity
      for that interconector. If you prefer to model all interconnectors together,
      you only set interconnector capacity for interconnector 1.
      \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n
      You can set the capacity per interconnector. However, not all of this capacity
      may be available for export, for example because the neighboring country suffers
      from electricity surpluses at the same time. It is therefore possible to limit
      the percentage of interconnection capacity available for export. In addition to capacity,
      it is also possible to set the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and price.
      The price determines the deployment order of interconnectors
      for import and export."

      title: Effects of increasing interconnector capacity
      short_description:
      description: "Countries in the EU are planning to invest in increasing interconnection
        capacity (see <a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1829\" target=\"_blank\">10-Year
        Network Development Plan (ENTSO-E)</a>). In the chart on the right, we qualitatively
        show how the electricity prices of two countries change if the interconnection
        capacity between them is doubled. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe blue lines show the
        hourly electricity prices for countries A and B in the reference year (2010).
        When the blue lines meet (e.g. hours 1-5) the price of electricity is the
        same for the two countries (convergence). This happens because they both use
        electricity from the cheapest producer available (electricity is being exported
        from the country with cheapest production to the other country).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAt
        all other times the blue lines do not match. This happens because, even if
        one of the countries has cheap production capacity available, the interconnector
        is already working at maximum capacity (is congested). The country that cannot
        import the cheap electricity will have to get it from a more expensive local
        producer. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe red lines show the prices of electricity when
        the interconnection capacity is doubled. Because the capacity is higher, the
        interconnector is congested less often and the price of electricity converges
        more frequently."

      short_description:
      description: "In some scenarios you will import electricity from outside your
        area. The production and distribution of this electricity could have caused
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions elsewhere. How much of these emissions do you want
        to attribute to your region? As a default, gram CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of
        imported electricity is set equal to the Dutch electricity mix, but you can
        change it yourself below. For more information checkout the '?'.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe

      title: Integration of the electricity markets
      short_description:
      description: "The electricity market is one of the last markets in the EU facing
        cross-border integration. Most industries are already competing in the EU
        Single Market. The proposal of the European Commission to create a common
        European energy policy was an important step towards harmonising national
        markets into working regional markets and finally a pan-European market.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn
        order to achieve this, both physical interconnection capacity and administrative
        market coupling are being realized. \r\n \r\nThe thinking is that markets
        are the most efficient means to assure demand is met by supply at the lowest
        costs. Overall expected benefits are: <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\t• Lower electricity
        costs <br/>\r\n\t• More equal electricity prices between countries<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn
        practice, market distortions by (the mismatch of) individual member states'
        policies may result in less than perfect market coupling."

      description: "The EU has the goal to increase the available capacity of renewable
        energy sources (RES) for 2020 (<a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/1830\"
        target=\"_blank\">Scenario Outlook and System Adequacy Forecast 2011-2025

        capacities of wind and solar up to 2020 targets. <br/><br/>\r\nIn the chart
        on the right, we can (qualitatively) see what the effect on the  <em>marginal
        electricity production costs</em> would be compared to the present situation.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        blue line shows the hourly costs of producing electricity in the present and
        the orange line when increasing the capacity of RES. The decrease in the costs
        results from the larger share of RES capacity, which has zero marginal electricity
        production costs (see <a href=\"/scenario/costs/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>). The average costs of producing electricity are therefore
        lower. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nNote that the costs for investments and installation
        of renewable generating capacity have not been included here. These are typically
        much higher than for non-renewable capacity. The <em>integral production costs</em>
        are therefore likely to increase with more renewable capacity."

    flexibility_flexibility_demand_response_hhp:
      title: Demand response - behavior of hybrid heat pumps
      short_description:
      description: "The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) is dependent on the
        ambient temperature and is depicted by the coefficient of performance (COP).
        The COP becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. Below you can
        set the so-called 'threshold COP': if the COP of the heat pump is below this
        threshold then the HHP switches from electricity to gas. You can choose a
        setting that is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can
        also choose a setting that produces less impact on the electricity network.
        \r\n</br></br>\r\n To help you decide the cost-optimal threshold COP setting
        from a consumer perspective, have a look at the chart on the right. It shows
        how much it costs to make a unit of heat with the HHP for space heating. For
        the gas part, these costs are independent of the COP (and therefore the outside
        temperature). The costs for the electrical part are decreasing with increasing
        COP (and increasing outside temperature). The intersection of the two curves
        is the cost-optimal COP setting for the given cost price gas and electricity.
        This cost price of gas and electricity can be adjusted below. The start value
        of the treshold COP slider matches the calculated cost-optimal threshold COP
        for space heating. \r\n</br></br>\r\n If you're interested in the impact of
        HHPs on the electricity grid, have a look at the chart that is shown when
        clicking on the 'Annual'-button in the right corner of the chart. This chart
        shows the hourly gas and electricity demand of HHPs. If you're interested
        in the share of gas and electricity used by HHPs, have a look at the table
        'Hybrid heat pump gas and electricity shares' in the chart list (Demand ->
        Households)."
    flexibility_flexibility_excess:
      title: Excess electricity
      short_description:
      description: "This page is about excess electricity and what to do with it.
        Wind turbines and solar panels are subject to volatile natural patterns. Their
        electricity supply does not match  demand and large amounts of volatile production
        capacity will therefore lead to excess electricity. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe
        ETM exports this excess, but this may not be an option, since our neighbors
        will likely face similar weather conditions and simultaneously peaking supply
        from wind and solar. Today, the only practical option for dealing with large
        amounts of excess is to shut down or 'curtail' production from wind and solar
        facilities. This effectively increases their production costs. It may therefore
        be economically attractive to store or convert the excess electricity into
        a useful form of energy. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe chart gives an indication of
        how the increase of production costs due to curtailment compares to storage
        or conversion technologies.\r\nMore detailed information can be found in our

        used to match demand directly and consequently lead to excess electricity.
        To prevent curtailment of excess electricity production, the ETM contains
        several flexibility technologies that can either store or convert the excess
        electricity. You can include these technologies in the <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/storage-in-household-batteries\">'Storage'</a>

        is reached; the remaining excess electricity is send to the second technology

        technologies vary in their ability to supply electricity during demand peaks.
        Batteries and other forms of storage have fast reaction times but require
        charging and are less suited to bridge long gaps in solar and wind production.
        Dispatchable power plants can supply power at any time but some of them require

      title: Heat
      short_description:
      description: "Will the future supply of heat be sufficient during every hour

        on the heat sources connected to the network. We distinguish between 'must-run'
        sources have a constant production of heat and 'dispatchable' sources that
        can be switched on during demand peaks. If none of these sources can supply
        sufficient heat, emergency supply is activated to prevent shortages.\r\n<br
        /><br />\r\n<b>Emergency supply</b><br />\r\nAn ideal back-up supply can be
        turned on quickly, has low installation and maintenance costs and uses a fuel
        that is easy to store or transport. For this reason, district heating networks
        often use gas burners as emergency supply in case (part of) the baseload heat
        sources fail. Smaller heating networks are typically connected to a smaller
        number of heat sources which increases the importance of a proper back-up
        system.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Peak demand</b><br />\r\nSome heat sources are
        better suited for supplying demand peaks than others. A heat buffer is able
        to respond quickly to changes in demand, but has to be big enough and needs
        to be filled first. A geothermal heat well is expensive and is therefore best
        used to produce heat non-stop. Burners using (green) gas or hydrogen can supply
        heat at any moment and are therefore a logical choice for meeting demand peaks.\r\n<br

        level of penetration? \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIf we assume wind power that exceeds
        demand cannot be exported, stored or converted into something economically
        useful, the remaining option is to curtail electricity production. If the
        installed capacity increases, the share of the electricity production that
        needs to be curtailed increases. As the share of curtailment increases, the
        total cost per unit of energy produced (€/MWh) will also increase. The same
        logic applies to solar PV.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe chart on the right indicates
        how the total production cost of wind turbines may increase due to curtailment.
        These costs can help in evaluating storage and conversion technologies. Instead
        of building more wind turbines, it might become economically interesting to

    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order:
      title: Merit order
      short_description:
      description: "Generally speaking, electricity generation follows electricity
        demand. The order in which power plants are dispatched is determined by the
        merit order. The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal
        costs. Those with the lowest marginal costs are dispatched first to meet demand;
        those with higher costs only when demand is high enough. Power plants with
        low operating costs therefore have a high number of operating hours while
        expensive ones may operate as little as a few hundred hours per year. This
        can play a large role in the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your scenario.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBy
        default the ETM calculates which power plants have to be dispatched for each
        hour in the year. This calculation is performed every time you make changes
        to your scenario. You can choose to switch the merit order calculation off;
        when switched off, all power plants will have the same full load hours in
        the future as in the present year of your scenario and these will not respond
        to your assumptions on fuel or other costs. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe merit order
        calculation in the ETM is simplified as it does not distinguish or rank individual
        plants, but only <strong>types</strong> of plants. For more information about

        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs. Not
        all electricity production technologies participate in the merit order.
        Renewable power from wind and solar has priority, for example, and so
        increasing the share of such technologies in your scenario will decrease
        the operating hours of the remaining plants. Since the merit order is
        determined solely by marginal costs, it is possible that more efficient
        technologies are 'pushed' out of the electricity generation mix this way

        <br/><br/>

        Furthermore, certain technologies are considered 'must-run'. These are
        mainly CHPs that satisfy a certain heat demand and do not primarily run to
        sell power. These must-runplants are therefore not included in the merit
        order. They do influence the operating hours of other plants of course.

        <br/><br/>

        The ETM calculates which power plants are dispatched at each hour in the
        year. The results areupdated every time you make changes to your scenario
        and communicated through various charts. You can download the resulting
        hourly load curves for each type of power plant as well as the power price
        curve for your scenario using the download buttons below.

      short_description:

        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs.
        Based on the hourly demand, the ETM calculates which power plants are
        dispatched each hour. Combined with the marginal costs of these
        plants, the ETM calculates the hourly electricity price. The ETM
        assumes that this price is equal to the marginal costs of the most
        expensive plant running.

        <br/><br/>

        Note that any mismatches between hourly supply and demand are due to
        insufficient production capacity in the scenario. These mismatches
        (resulting in blackhout hours) are represented in the 'deficit' column
        in the electricity load curves data export.

        <br/><br/>

        The hourly load curves for all electricity production and consumption for your scenario, as well as the price curve, can be downloaded following the links below.

        in the past, as well as periods with little wind and sun. This may happen
        again in the future, and low temperatures may negatively affect the ability
        for air and hybrid heat pumps to satisfy demand. Besides that, a lack of wind
        and sun may negatively affect the electricity production from wind and solar
        power. To explore these effects for a scenario for (a region within) the Netherlands
        a year with extreme weather conditions can be selected.\r\n</p>\r\nFor more
