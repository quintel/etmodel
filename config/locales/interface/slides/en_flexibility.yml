      title: Electricity interconnectors
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <strong>domestic electricity market</strong> in your scenario is
        connected to one or more <strong>external markets</strong> via
        interconnectors. These interconnectors allow for importing and exporting
        electricity.</p>

        <p>Import occurs whenever doing so is cheaper than using domestic
        electricity generation options. By default, electricity is exported only
        when there is a surplus from
        <a
          href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order/#participants"
          target="_blank"
        >volatile and must-run sources</a>.</p>

        <p>In real-world markets, electricity may be exported whenever the
        production price is lower than that of the external market. Dispatchable
        plants can then also be used for export. Enabling this feature with the
        toggle below may significantly increase the amount of
        electricity generated in your scenario.

      title: Interconnector 1
      short_description:
      description: "The difference between supply and demand of electricity on an
      hourly basis can be imported or exported. Many countries import and export
      electricity with their neighboring countries through different interconnectors.
      In the ETM it is possible to model up to six different electrical interconnectors
      between countries. You add an interconnector by setting interconnection capacity
      for that interconector. If you prefer to model all interconnectors together,
      you only set interconnector capacity for interconnector 1.
      \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n
      You can set the capacity per interconnector. However, not all of this capacity
      may be available for export, for example because the neighboring country suffers
      from electricity surpluses at the same time. It is therefore possible to limit
      the percentage of interconnection capacity available for export. In addition to capacity,
      it is also possible to set the corresponding CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and price.
      The price determines the deployment order of interconnectors
      for import and export."

      title: Demand response - behavior of hybrid heat pumps
      short_description:
      description: "The efficiency of hybrid heat pumps (HHP) is dependent on the
        ambient temperature and is depicted by the coefficient of performance (COP).
        The COP becomes lower as the outside temperature decreases. Below you can
        set the so-called 'threshold COP': if the COP of the heat pump is below this
        threshold then the HHP switches from electricity to gas. You can choose a
        setting that is most financially attractive for the consumer, but you can
        also choose a setting that produces less impact on the electricity network.
        </br></br>
        To help you decide the cost-optimal threshold COP setting
        from a consumer perspective, have a look at the chart on the right. It shows
        how much it costs to make a unit of heat with the HHP for space heating. For
        the gas part, these costs are independent of the COP (and therefore the outside
        temperature). The costs for the electrical part are decreasing with increasing
        COP (and increasing outside temperature). The intersection of the two curves
        is the cost-optimal COP setting for the given cost price gas and electricity.
        This cost price of gas and electricity can be adjusted below. The start value
        of the treshold COP slider matches the calculated cost-optimal threshold COP
        for space heating.

      title: Order of flexibility options
      short_description:
      description: "Wind turbines and solar panels are subject to volatile natural
        patterns. The electricity that they produce might therefore not always be
        used to match demand directly and consequently lead to excess electricity.
        To prevent curtailment of excess electricity production, the ETM contains
        several flexibility technologies that can either store or convert the excess
        electricity. You can include these technologies in the <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_storage/storage-in-household-batteries\">'Storage'</a>

        which the flexibility technologies have to be applied. The ETM will send excess
        electricity to the first technology on your list until its maximum capacity
        is reached; the remaining excess electricity is send to the second technology
        on your list and so on. Finally, any remaining excess electricity is curtailed.
        You can drag and drop the technologies in the desired order."

        the electricity network. It is therefore desirable to be able to curtail these
        peaks. In some cases it is smart to connect solar parks to only a certain
        percentage of the peak power. With the sliders below it is possible to set

      title: Balance of the energy system
      short_description:
      description: |
        In order to balance demand and supply <i>within a year</i>, flexible technologies are required.
        The charts in this section provide insight into the extent to which flexibility
        is needed in your scenario. You can then provide this flexibility need by setting flexible
        technologies in the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/excess_electricity/order-of-flexibility-options">Excess electricity</a>
        section, or by changing your dispatchable technologies in the
        <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants">Supply</a>
        section. </br></br>
        The first chart shows the demand and supply of electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat
        per month. This gives you insight into the balance of your energy system throughout
        the year: when does imbalance occur? Which carriers are not in balance? If you are
        curious about the balance within a month, there is an option to zoom in. By clicking
        on a carrier in a specific month, a new chart opens that zooms in on the hourly values ​​
        of that carrier in that month. </br> </br>
        To get a good picture of this (im)balance, only the baseload energy demand and the must-run and
        volatile production are shown in this chart. This allows
        you to clearly see the "need for flexibility" of the system. </br></br>
        What exactly is meant by baseload demand and inflexible supply is explained below:
        <ul> <li> Demand is the end use of the different sectors. This does <b>not</b> include the
        energy demand of flex technologies that balance the system, such as gas / hydrogen
        for dispatchable power plants, electricity that enters batteries or gas / hydrogen
        in gas storage facilities.</li>
        <li> Supply is the must-run and volatile production, such as wind turbines and solar
        thermal plants. This does <b>not</b> include the production by flex technologies, such as heat
        / electricity production by dispatchable sources, electricity from batteries or
        gas / hydrogen from gas storage facilities.</li>
    flexibility_overview_inflexible_imbalance:
      title: Imbalance of the energy system
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the imbalance between supply and demand for electricity, gas,
        hydrogen and heat per month. The imbalance is calculated by subtracting the demand
        from the supply, this is called the "residual load". <br /><br />Negative values mean "surpluses"
        of energy and positive values "shortages". This way you can gain insight into the
        balance of your energy system throughout the year: in which months does an imbalance occur?
        Which carriers are not in balance? Are these shortages or surpluses of energy? If you are
        curious about the imbalance within a month, you can click on that specific month and a chart
        will open with "residual load" profiles for that month.</br></br>
    flexibility_overview_cumulative_imbalance:
      title: Seasonal balance of the energy system
      short_description:
      description: |
        This chart shows the following two lines:
        <ul> <li> The line exluding correction in the chart shows the sum of all shortages and surpluses of
        electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat throughout the year. When the line is rising, it means
        there were net surpluses in that hour and when the line is falling, it means there
        were net shortages. If the end point of the chart is higher than the starting point,
        this means that energy surpluses outweigh deficits.<br /><br />
        Surpluses at one point in time can be used to resolve deficits at a later point, either by
        storing the surpluses or by converting one carrier into another. By comparing the start and end point of this line, you can see how much
        "leeway" you have to use these surpluses in your scenario to make up for the shortages.
        So how much conversion / storage losses you can afford to eventually balance the system.</li><br /><br />
        <li> For the corrected line it is assumed that the energy system is already in balance at an annual level: that all generated
        energy goes somewhere and all required energy comes from somewhere. This gives a rough
        estimate of your total required storage capacity to ensure that carriers can be used
        at the right time. This total required storage capacity can be read from the highest
        value of this line. </li>

      description: "Will there be sufficient power supply in the future to meet demand
        at any moment? For example, is your scenario robust for extended periods of
        low wind and solar generation combined with demand peaks? Renewable power
        production presents challenges for the security of supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe
        chart to the right shows how reliable power supply is for every hour per year
        in your scenario. In the dashboard below you can see the number of (expected)
        blackout hours due to a lack of power supply.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nProduction
        technologies vary in their ability to supply electricity during demand peaks.
        Batteries and other forms of storage have fast reaction times but require
        charging and are less suited to bridge long gaps in solar and wind production.
        Dispatchable power plants can supply power at any time but some of them require
        many operating hours per year to cover their costs or are too expensive to
        turn on and off repeatedly.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n(Renewable) gas turbines and
        engines using green gas or hydrogen are promising technologies to provide
        back-up capacity for a future energy system relying on wind and solar power.
        This is due to their fast ramping speeds and relatively low investment costs.\r\n<br
        /><br />\r\n<strong>Tip:</strong> Take a look at the <a href=\"/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_weather/extreme-weather-conditions\">Weather
        conditions</a> section to explore how variations in outdoor temperature, wind
        speeds and solar radiation impact your scenario. Is your scenario able to
        cope with extreme weather conditions? Will people be left in the dark during
        periods of very low wind and solar generation?"

      title: Heat
      short_description:
      description: "Will the future supply of heat be sufficient during every hour
        per year to meet demand of district heating networks? This depends of course
        on the heat sources connected to the network. We distinguish between 'must-run'
        sources have a constant production of heat and 'dispatchable' sources that
        can be switched on during demand peaks. If none of these sources can supply
        sufficient heat, emergency supply is activated to prevent shortages.\r\n<br
        /><br />\r\n<b>Emergency supply</b><br />\r\nAn ideal back-up supply can be
        turned on quickly, has low installation and maintenance costs and uses a fuel
        that is easy to store or transport. For this reason, district heating networks
        often use gas burners as emergency supply in case (part of) the baseload heat
        sources fail. Smaller heating networks are typically connected to a smaller
        number of heat sources which increases the importance of a proper back-up
        system.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>Peak demand</b><br />\r\nSome heat sources are
        better suited for supplying demand peaks than others. A heat buffer is able
        to respond quickly to changes in demand, but has to be big enough and needs
        to be filled first. A geothermal heat well is expensive and is therefore best
        used to produce heat non-stop. Burners using (green) gas or hydrogen can supply
        heat at any moment and are therefore a logical choice for meeting demand peaks.\r\n<br

    flexibility_merit_order_merit_order:
      title: Merit order
      short_description:
      description: "Generally speaking, electricity generation follows electricity
        demand. The order in which power plants are dispatched is determined by the
        merit order. The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal
        costs. Those with the lowest marginal costs are dispatched first to meet demand;
        those with higher costs only when demand is high enough. Power plants with
        low operating costs therefore have a high number of operating hours while
        expensive ones may operate as little as a few hundred hours per year. This
        can play a large role in the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of your scenario.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBy
        default the ETM calculates which power plants have to be dispatched for each
        hour in the year. This calculation is performed every time you make changes
        to your scenario. You can choose to switch the merit order calculation off;
        when switched off, all power plants will have the same full load hours in
        the future as in the present year of your scenario and these will not respond
        to your assumptions on fuel or other costs. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe merit order
        calculation in the ETM is simplified as it does not distinguish or rank individual
        plants, but only <strong>types</strong> of plants. For more information about
        the merit order calculation <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order\"

      short_description:
      description: |
        The merit order ranks power plants according to their marginal costs. Not
        all electricity production technologies participate in the merit order.
        Renewable power from wind and solar has priority, for example, and so
        increasing the share of such technologies in your scenario will decrease
        the operating hours of the remaining plants. Since the merit order is
        determined solely by marginal costs, it is possible that more efficient
        technologies are 'pushed' out of the electricity generation mix this way

        <br/><br/>

        Furthermore, certain technologies are considered 'must-run'. These are
        mainly CHPs that satisfy a certain heat demand and do not primarily run to
        sell power. These must-runplants are therefore not included in the merit
        order. They do influence the operating hours of other plants of course.

        <br/><br/>

        The ETM calculates which power plants are dispatched at each hour in the
        year. The results areupdated every time you make changes to your scenario
        and communicated through various charts. You can download the resulting

        The ETM calculates the hourly production and demand of gas, electricity, heat and hydrogen.
        On this page you can upload your own hourly profiles to overwrite the default profiles used
        in the ETM. You can upload four types of profiles:

        <br /><br />

        <b>1. Demand profiles</b>
        <br />
        These profiles specify for each hour per year (8760 hours) the fraction of annual demand
        used in that hour. The sum of all hours should be 1. The ETM will check this and normalise
        the profile to 1 if necessary. Examples: electric buses, industry heating.

        <br /><br />

        <b>2. Production profiles</b>
        <br />
        These profiles specify for each hour per year the fraction of installed capacity used in
        that hour. The sum of all hours should equal the total annual full load hours of that
        technology. Examples: solar PV, wind offshore.

        <br /><br />

        <b>3. Temperature profile</b>
        <br />
        This profile specifies the outdoor temperature for each hour per year. The unit is °C.

        <br /><br />

        <b>4. Price curves</b>
        <br />
        These profiles specify a price for each hour per year. The unit is €/MWh. Example: imported
        electricity.
