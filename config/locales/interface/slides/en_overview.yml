      title: Overview
      short_description:
      description: |
        This section gives a general overview of the current scenario.<br/><br/>
        When starting a new scenario, this overview shows the current energy system of the selected
        region. As changes are made in the different sections of the model, this overview will
        update to reflect the impact. When opening an existing scenario, this overview will already
        show the impact of the choices made in that scenario.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right shows a complete picture of the annual energy flows in the scenario,
        from energy source to final energy demand.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on how to build a scenario, or general information about the ETM,
        please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com">documentation</a>.
    demand:
      title: Demand
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/demand/households/overview">Demand</a> section energy use
        can be explored per sector, such as households, industry and transport. By adjusting the
        sliders, the effects of changes in energy demand on the overall energy system can be
        observed. <br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates the change of final energetic energy demand per
        sector between the start and future year.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on the demand section, please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/demand">documentation on Demand</a>.
    supply:
      title: Supply
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants">Supply</a> section, assumptions
        can be made about how energy will be produced and supplied in the region.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates how much electricity is produced with respect to demand
        and shows the sources of electricity production.
        The results are shown for the start and future year.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on the supply section, please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/supply">documentation on Supply</a>.
    flexibility:
      title: Flexibility
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility">Flexibility</a>
        section of the ETM allows for exploration of how flexibility options can help balance supply
        and demand in the energy system. By adjusting various parameters related to energy storage,
        demand response and other flexibility measures, their impact on the overall energy system
        can be observed.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right shows the hourly mismatch of inflexible supply and demand
        for the energy carriers electricity, heat, hydrogen and network gas.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on the flexibility section, please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/flexibility">documentation on Flexibility</a>.
    emissions:
      title: Emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">Emissions</a>
        section, assumptions related to emission factors, greenhouse gas emissions and carbon
        capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) can be made.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right depicts the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1990 for this region and
        the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per sector in the start and future year.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on the emissions section, please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-main-principles">documentation on Emissions</a>.
    costs:
      title: Costs & efficiencies
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/costs/specs_electricity/coal-plants">Costs & efficiencies</a>
        section, assumptions can be made about the costs and efficiency of, among others, energy
        production technologies, energy infrastructure and fuels.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates the annual costs associated with different aspects of
        the energy system in the start and future year.
        <br/><br/>
        For more information on the costs section, please consult the
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/cost-main-principles">documentation on Costs</a>.
