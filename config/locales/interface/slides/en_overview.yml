      title: How does the Energy Transition Model work?
      short_description:
      description: |
        The ETM helps you explore future energy scenarios for a region
        of your choice. The model is easy to use by following these steps:
        <ol><li>Before you start, think about the goal of your scenario, then you know what to focus on.</li>
        <li>The menu on the left displays all sectors that either use (<a href="/scenario/demand/households/population-housing-stock"
        >Demand</a>) or produce energy (<a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants"
        >Supply</a>). For each sector you can use sliders to indicate what you think
        the future will be like. You can easily undo your changes by resetting your
        slider, so just play around! For example, you can start with <a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water"
        >space heating in households</a> or explore <a href="/scenario/demand/transport/overview"
        >transport and mobility</a>. <br/>
        <i>Optional: advanced users can use the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility"
        >Flexibility</a> section to match demand and supply on specific timescales, the
        <a href="/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">Emissions</a> section for assumptions on other greenhouse gas emissions
        or CCUS and the <a href="/scenario/costs/fuel_costs/fossil-fuels">Costs & efficiencies</a> section for cost assumptions or efficiency adjustments. </i></li>
        <li> The ETM will immediately show you the result of your actions: at the bottom of your screen,
        indicators show the impact on the entire system (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, energy savings, costs).
        On the right, charts display specific information for each section of the model. If you lock the chart
        it will remain visible as you navigate through the model. You can add charts by clicking "see more charts"
        (top right). <br/>
        For a more complete overview of results you can take a look at the scenario report under the header <a href="/scenario/data/data_visuals/scenario-report"
        >Results & data</a>. You can always return to a certain part of the model to make more changes. </li>
        <li>You can share your scenario with others by saving your scenario: click on
        'Save scenario' (top right) and share the scenario link. <br/>
        <i>Please note: the ETM is updated periodically. Save your scenario to ensure that outcomes
        stay stable over time! </i></li></ol><br/>
        You are in the driver's seat. The ETM contains no hidden assumptions, like price or technology
        developments over time etc. If you do nothing, the future will not change. <br/><br/>
        The ETM is fully open source: under the header <a href="/scenario/data/data_sources/region_data">Results & data</a>
        you can see the data sources that are used in the model. <br/><br/>

    overview_co2_emissions:
      title: Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      short_description:
      description: "How much CO<sub>2</sub> is currently emitted by the various sectors
        in your region?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n
        The chart on the right compares CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between
        1990, the present and the future. The year 1990 is often used as a reference
        year for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions targets.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe ETM takes into account energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
        which are emitted in domestic energy use and production, as well as non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the Fertilizers sector.
        Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in other sectors and other green house gases (e.g. methane) can be changed within the
        <a href=\"/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview\">Emissions</a> section.
        You can find more information in the
        <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-overview-per-sector\"
        target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.
        \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe percentage of CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction with
        respect to 1990 remains visible in the bar at the bottom as you navigate through
        the ETM. You can re-visit the chart on the right at any time by clicking on
        this number at the bottom. Do you prefer to see the
        values of the chart in a table? Click on the table icon at the top right of
        the chart."
    overview_final_demand:
      title: Total energy demand
      short_description:
      description: "How much energy is used by the different sectors in your region
        and what is the impact of adjustments to the energy system?\r\n<br/> <br/>\r\nThe
        chart on the right gives you an overview of the total <em>energetic</em> energy
        demand per sector (excl. feedstocks). Which sector is the biggest consumer
        of energy? That sector might be a good place to start your scenario; go to
        \"Demand\" and select that sector.\r\n<br/> <br/>\r\nWithout any adjustments,
        the energy demand remains virtually the same, because no assumptions have
        yet been made about the future. The fact that there is a slight difference
        in energy use between the future and the present at the start, can be attributed
        to the use of the electricity market module: it is not used in the current
        year and is used in the future year (the <a href =\"/scenario/supply/merit_order/merit-order\">Merit
        order</a> section has more information about the electricity market module)."
    scenario_overview:
      title: Overview
      short_description:
      description: |
        This section gives a general overview of the current scenario.<br/><br/>
        When starting a new scenario, this overview shows the current energy system of the selected
        region. As changes are made in the different sections of the model, this overview will
        update to reflect the impact. When opening an existing scenario, this overview will already
        show the impact of the choices made in that scenario.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right shows a complete picture of the annual energy flows in the scenario,
        from energy source to final energy demand.
    demand:
      title: Demand
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/demand/households/overview">Demand</a> section allows for
        exploration of how energy is used in different sectors, such as households, industry
        and transport. By adjusting various parameters, the effects of changes in
        energy demand on the overall energy system can be observed.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates the development of final energetic energy demand per
        energy carrier between the start and end year of this scenario.
    supply:
      title: Supply
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants">Supply</a> section, assumptions
        can be made about how energy will be produced and supplied in the region.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates how much electricity is produced with respect to demand
        and shows the sources of electricity production.
        The results are shown for the start year and end year of the scenario.
    flexibility:
      title: Flexibility
      short_description:
      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility">Flexibility</a>
        section of the ETM allows for exploration of how flexibility options can help balance supply
        and demand in the energy system. By adjusting various parameters related to energy storage,
        demand response and other flexibility measures, their impact on the overall energy system
        can be observed.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right shows the hourly mismatch of inflexible supply and demand
        for the energy carriers electricity, heat, hydrogen and network gas.
    emissions:
      title: Emissions
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">Emissions</a>
        section, assumptions related to emission factors, greenhouse gas emissions and carbon
        capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) can be made.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right depicts the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 1990 for this region and
        the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per sector in the start year and end year of the scenario.
    costs:
      title: Costs & efficiencies
      short_description:
      description: |
        In the <a href="/scenario/costs/specs_electricity/coal-plants">Costs & efficiencies</a>
        section, assumptions can be made about the costs and efficiency of, among others, energy
        production technologies, energy infrastructure and fuels.<br/><br/>
        The chart on the right illustrates the annual costs associated with different aspects of
        the energy system in the start year and end year of the scenario.
