      title: How does the Energy Transition Model work?
      short_description:
      description: |
        The ETM helps you explore future energy scenarios for a region
        of your choice. The model is easy to use by following these steps:
        <ol><li>Before you start, think about the goal of your scenario, then you know what to focus on.</li>
        <li>The menu on the left displays all sectors that either use (<a href="/scenario/demand/households/population-housing-stock"
        >Demand</a>) or produce energy (<a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants"
        >Supply</a>). For each sector you can use sliders to indicate what you think
        the future will be like. You can easily undo your changes by resetting your
        slider, so just play around! For example, you can start with <a href="/scenario/demand/households/space-heating-and-hot-water"
        >space heating in households</a> or explore <a href="/scenario/demand/transport/overview"
        >transport and mobility</a>. </br>
        <i>Optional: advanced users can use the <a href="/scenario/flexibility/flexibility_overview/what-is-flexibility"
        >Flexibility</a> section to match demand and supply on specific timescales, the
        <a href="/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">Emissions</a> section for assumptions on other greenhouse gas emissions
        or CCUS and the <a href="/scenario/costs/fuel_costs/fossil-fuels">Costs & efficiencies</a> section for cost assumptions or efficiency adjustments. </i></li>
        <li> The ETM will immediately show you the result of your actions: at the bottom of your screen,
        indicators show the impact on the entire system (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, energy savings, costs).
        On the right, charts display specific information for each section of the model. If you lock the chart
        it will remain visible as you navigate through the model. You can add charts by clicking "see more charts"
        (top right). </br>
        For a more complete overview of results you can take a look at the scenario report under the header <a href="/scenario/data/data_visuals/scenario-report"
        >Results & data</a>. You can always return to a certain part of the model to make more changes. </li>
        <li>You can share your scenario with others by saving your scenario: click on
        'Save scenario' (top right) and share the scenario link. <br/>
        <i>Please note: the ETM is updated periodically. Save your scenario to ensure that outcomes
        stay stable over time! </i></li></ol></br>
        You are in the driver's seat. The ETM contains no hidden assumptions, like price or technology
        developments over time etc. If you do nothing, the future will not change. </br></br>
        The ETM is fully open source: under the header <a href="/scenario/data/data_sources/region_data">Results & data</a>
        you can see the data sources that are used in the model. </br></br>

    overview_co2_emissions:
      title: Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
      short_description:
      description: "How much CO<sub>2</sub> is currently emitted by the various sectors
        in your region?\r\n</br></br>\r\n
        The chart on the right compares CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between
        1990, the present and the future. The year 1990 is often used as a reference
        year for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions targets.\r\n</br></br>\r\nThe ETM takes into account energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions,
        which are emitted in domestic energy use and production, as well as non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the Fertilizers sector.
        Non-energetic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in other sectors and other green house gases (e.g. methane) can be changed within the
        <a href=\"/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview\">Emissions</a> section.
        You can find more information in the
        <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-overview-per-sector\"
        target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.
        \r\n</br></br>\r\nThe percentage of CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction with
        respect to 1990 remains visible in the bar at the bottom as you navigate through
        the ETM. You can re-visit the chart on the right at any time by clicking on
        this number at the bottom. Do you prefer to see the
        values of the chart in a table? Click on the table icon at the top right of
        the chart."
    overview_final_demand:
      title: Total energy demand
      short_description:
      description: "How much energy is used by the different sectors in your region
        and what is the impact of adjustments to the energy system?\r\n</br> </br>\r\nThe
        chart on the right gives you an overview of the total <em>energetic</em> energy
        demand per sector (excl. feedstocks). Which sector is the biggest consumer
        of energy? That sector might be a good place to start your scenario; go to
        \"Demand\" and select that sector.\r\n</br> </br>\r\nWithout any adjustments,
        the energy demand remains virtually the same, because no assumptions have
        yet been made about the future. The fact that there is a slight difference
        in energy use between the future and the present at the start, can be attributed
        to the use of the electricity market module: it is not used in the current
        year and is used in the future year (the <a href =\"/scenario/supply/merit_order/merit-order\">Merit
        order</a> section has more information about the electricity market module)."

        \r\n</br></br>\r\nThe Sankey diagram on the right gives
        a complete picture of the energy flows in your region, from energy sources
        to final energy demand. The thickness of the arrows indicates the amount
        of energy. You can click on different parts of the diagram to zoom in on
        specific energy flows."

      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/demand/households/overview">Demand</a> section of the ETM allows you to
        explore how energy is used in different sectors, such as households, industry,
        and transport. By adjusting various parameters, you can see how changes in
        energy consumption affect the overall energy system.
        </br></br>
        The diagram on the right illustrates the final energy demand per sector in your region.

      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/supply/electricity/coal-plants">Supply</a> section of the ETM allows you to explore
        how energy is produced and supplied in your region. You can adjust various parameters
        related to energy production technologies, capacities, and sources to see how they
        impact the overall energy system.
        </br></br>
        The diagram on the right illustrates the electricity supply mix in your region,
        showing the contributions from different energy sources.

      short_description:
      description: |
        The <a href="/scenario/emissions/other_emissions/overview">Emissions</a> section of the ETM allows you to explore
        how different sectors contribute to greenhouse gas emissions in your region. By adjusting
        various parameters, you can see how changes in emissions affect the overall energy system
        and progress towards climate goals.
        </br></br>
        The diagram on the right illustrates the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per sector in your region.

        The <a href="/scenario/costs/specs_electricity/coal-plants">Costs</a> section of the ETM allows you to explore
        the economic aspects of the energy system in your region. You can adjust various
        parameters related to costs of energy production, infrastructure, and technologies
        to see how they impact the overall energy system.
        </br></br>
        The diagram on the right illustrates the total costs associated with the energy system
        in your region.
