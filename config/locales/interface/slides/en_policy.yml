    policy_dependence_foreign_dependence:
      title: Foreign energy imports
      short_description: ''
      description: "Import and export contribute positively to the economic activity
        of a country. Mutual dependence strengthens trade relations and creates stability
        between countries. Security of supply is an important aspect for energy trade,
        because economic activity is not possible without energy supply. That is why
        a balanced view on this topic is important; not all energy carriers ‘travel
        easily’, and not all energy flows are that ‘secure’ in the long term. To what
        extent do you want your country to import foreign energy?\r\n<div class='nl-only'>\r\n
