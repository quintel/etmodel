        biomass alternatives. Here, you can choose the relative share of coal and
        biocoal. Currently, only the pulverized coal plant and the coal plant for

      short_description:
      description: "How will green gas be produced in the future? Currently fermentation
        is the dominant production technology. In the future, gasification may become
        an important technology as well. Below you can specify the future market shares
        of green gas production technologies. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nCaution: The costs
        of green gas do not change automatically when altering the green gas production
        mix. This is because the price of green gas is not fully determined by its
        production costs. Green gas is a scarce resource, which means that its market
        price may be well above (levelised) production costs. In the costs section
        you can change the <a href=\"/scenario/costs/fuel_costs/biofuels\">price of
        green gas</a> and see how this price relates to the average production costs.
        Also note that the production costs of green gas are not optimized, mainly
        for the gasification technologies. Since the technologies are fairly new;
        there are not many practical examples on which the costs can be based.\r\n<br

    supply_ccus_capture:
      title: Capture of CO<sub>2</sub>
      description: "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a group of technologies to capture
        the CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted in (e.g.) industrial processes and subsequently to store
        or 'recycle' these emissions. In this section you can explore the role CCUS could play in the
        future energy system. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be captured in industrial processes, the
        energy sector or can be captured directly from the ambient air. Below, you can make assumptions
        about the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> per technology. <br/><br/>
        The chart to the right shows the amount of captured CO<sub>2</sub> ('supply of CO<sub>2</sub>')
        in your scenario and what happens with this CO<sub>2</sub> (storage, utilisation). If more CO<sub>2</sub>
        is captured than used, the chart shows a 'surplus' of CO<sub>2</sub>. Vice versa, the chart shows a
        'deficit' if less is captured.<br/><br/>
        More information about the energy use of CCUS in your scenario can be found in

        Below you can specify how the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in your scenario is used. If more CO<sub>2</sub> is stored or
        utilised (CO<sub>2</sub> demand) than captured (CO<sub>2</sub> supply), the ETM shows a CO<sub>2</sub> 'deficit'.

      description: "Below you can specify how captured CO<sub>2</sub> will be transported in the future.
        This can be done via ships or pipelines. The first option is well suited for scenarios with
        relatively small CO<sub>2</sub> volumes or when CO<sub>2</sub> sources are located in more remote areas.
        Pipelines, on the other hand, are useful in scenarios with higher volumes of captured CO<sub>2</sub> or
        when CCUS activities are concentrated in the same location."
    supply_ccus_steel_coal_gas:
      title: Coal gas plants
      description: |
        Coal gases are a side product from steel production, that are only present in your scenario
        if steel is produced through the blast furnace production route. If you want to reduce the
        production of coal gases altogether, you can switch to a different steel production process
        in the <a href="/scenario/demand/industry/steel">steel sector</a>. </br></br>
        Part of these gases are used in the steel-making process itself. The remainder is
        typically used in CHPs and power plants for electricity and heat production. Due to
        the high carbon content of coal gases, this is very CO<sub>2</sub>-intensive. An alternative
        use for these coal gases is to transform them into feedstock for the chemical industry
        (steel-to-chemicals). </br></br>
        With the sliders below you can specify which share of the coal gases is used for electricity
        and heat generation and which share is transformed into feedstock.
    supply_co2_emissions_biomass:
      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biomass
      short_description:
      description: "Usually no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are attributed to biomass
        as biomass absorbs as much CO<sub>2</sub> as is emitted during combustion
        (over the complete life cycle). However, the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by combustion
        of biomass is not always absorbed within a time-scale that is relevant for
        climate change (the life cycle of biomass varies from a couple of months to
        over a century). Therefore, it is possible to experience what the on-the-spot
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biomass are by including them in the chart on
        the right. <a href=\"https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/co2-biomass\"

      description: Coal-fired power plants tend to be running as much as possible.
        They produce roughly twice as much CO<sub>2</sub> as gas-fired ones. They
        are not flexible in their output.<br/><br/>
        Below, you can specify the installed capacities of various coal-fired power plant
        technologies. In the <a href='/scenario/emissions/ccus/capture-of-co2'>CCUS</a> section,
        it is possible to add a CO<sub>2</sub> capture unit to these power plants to reduce

      short_description: ''
      description: Gas-fired power plants produce roughly half as much CO<sub>2</sub>
        as coal-fired ones. They are quite flexible in their output and therefore
        used to fill in peaks in demand.<br/><br/>

        and for small modular reactors. The ETM does not include any CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions for nuclear power plants. </br></br>
        By default all nuclear power plants are run as dispatchable producers. Due to
        their high captial costs and low operating costs, large reactors tend to run as
        much as possible. You therefore also have the option to model the <b>large reactors</b> as
        <a href="https://docs.energytransitionmodel.com/main/merit-order#producers" target=\"_blank\"> 'must-run'</a>
        power plants by switching the toggle. This means that they will run with a

        Shipping of liquified green ammonia (and then reforming it to hydrogen) is seen as
        a more practical option for importing large amounts of green hydrogen than transporting
        the hydrogen directly. By default, the emissions of imported ammonia are set equal to the
        emissions of ammonia produced using steam methane reforming, because this currently is the
        dominant production route. If you expect to import mostly green ammonia, you can change the
