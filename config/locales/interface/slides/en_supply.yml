      description: "The fuel mix of your coal plants can be made greener by using
        biomass alternatives. Here, you can choose the relative share of coal and
        biocoal. Currently, only the pulverized coal plant and the coal plant for

    supply_biomass_greengas_production:
      title: Green gas production
      short_description:
      description: "How will green gas be produced in the future? Currently fermentation
        is the dominant production technology. In the future, gasification may become
        an important technology as well. Below you can specify the future market shares
        of green gas production technologies. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nCaution: The costs
        of green gas do not change automatically when altering the green gas production
        mix. This is because the price of green gas is not fully determined by its
        production costs. Green gas is a scarce resource, which means that its market
        price may be well above (levelised) production costs. In the costs section
        you can change the <a href=\"/scenario/costs/fuel_costs/biofuels\">price of
        green gas</a> and see how this price relates to the average production costs.
        Also note that the production costs of green gas are not optimized, mainly
        for the gasification technologies. Since the technologies are fairly new;
        there are not many practical examples on which the costs can be based.\r\n<br

    supply_ccus_capture:
      title: Capture of CO<sub>2</sub>
      description: "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a group of technologies to capture
        the CO<sub>2</sub> that is emitted in (e.g.) industrial processes and subsequently to store
        or 'recycle' these emissions. In this section you can explore the role CCUS could play in the
        future energy system. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be captured in industrial processes, the
        energy sector or can be captured directly from the ambient air. Below, you can make assumptions
        about the capture of CO<sub>2</sub> per technology. <br/><br/>
        The chart to the right shows the amount of captured CO<sub>2</sub> ('supply of CO<sub>2</sub>')
        in your scenario and what happens with this CO<sub>2</sub> (storage, utilisation). If more CO<sub>2</sub>
        is captured than used, the chart shows a 'surplus' of CO<sub>2</sub>. Vice versa, the chart shows a
        'deficit' if less is captured.<br/><br/>

        Below you can specify how the captured CO<sub>2</sub> in your scenario is used. If more CO<sub>2</sub> is stored or
        utilised (CO<sub>2</sub> demand) than captured (CO<sub>2</sub> supply), the ETM shows a CO<sub>2</sub> 'deficit'.

      title: Transport of CO<sub>2</sub>
      description: "Below you can specify how captured CO<sub>2</sub> will be transported in the future.
        This can be done via ships or pipelines. The first option is well suited for scenarios with
        relatively small CO<sub>2</sub> volumes or when CO<sub>2</sub> sources are located in more remote areas.
        Pipelines, on the other hand, are useful in scenarios with higher volumes of captured CO<sub>2</sub> or
        when CCUS activities are concentrated in the same location."

      title: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biomass
      short_description:
      description: "Usually no CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are attributed to biomass
        as biomass absorbs as much CO<sub>2</sub> as is emitted during combustion
        (over the complete life cycle). However, the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by combustion
        of biomass is not always absorbed within a time-scale that is relevant for
        climate change (the life cycle of biomass varies from a couple of months to
        over a century). Therefore, it is possible to experience what the on-the-spot
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of biomass are by including them in the chart on

        nuclear power plants. By default nuclear power plants are modeled as dispatchable
        plants. The toggle below the sliders allows you to make them 'must-run' plants
        (independent of electricity demand) with a flat production profile. This functionality
        was added, because nuclear plants tend to run as much as possible. This is
        because of their low operating costs and high capital costs.

        sources (such as geothermal, solar thermal and residual heat) and dispatchable
        heat sources. In contrast to the first category, dispatchable heat sources
        can be turned on or off at will. The ETM calculates for every hour per year
        how much heat from must-run and volatile sources is available. If heat demand
        exceeds this supply in a given hour, dispatchable heat sources will be switched
        on to ensure that no deficit occurs.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBelow it is possible
        to change the (merit) order of dispatchable heat sources: which heat source

        to attribute to your region? As a default, the emissions (in kg CO<sub>2</sub>
        per MWh hydrogen) are set equal to the emissions of hydrogen produced with
        Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), since over 90% of hydrogen produced today comes
        from SMR. However, you can change the emissions yourself below. Click on the

      description: "The high voltage (HV) network is used for the long distance transport
        of electricity, both within the country and for import and export. Large power
        plants and large industrial users are connected to the HV network.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBuilding
        new power plants requires investing in network capacity. These costs cannot
        be avoided. The costs for the HV network are directly proportional to the
        generation capacity built.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThere is no distinction
        between the required investments for the different types of power plants,
        as this depends on generation capacity. The only exception is offshore wind
        turbines for which extra offshore cables are required.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
        significant changes to the amount of electricity imported or exported will
        also incur network investments since extra interconnectors are required.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn

        users, are attached to the low voltage (LV) and medium voltage (MV) networks.
        \r\n\r\n <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThese electricity networks consist of cables (to
        distribute electricity to the various users) and transformers (to transform
        the voltage from high to low). Both cables and transformers can only handle
        a limited amount of capacity.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe required capacity
        in the networks is determined by the number of users and the appliances used
        by those users. Technologies such as electric vehicles and electric heaters
        or heat pumps in particular significantly increase the required capacity.
        \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIf the required network capacity exceeds the available
        capacity network infrastructure investments  will be required to add new cables
        and transformers. It is in particular desirable to avoid investments in the
        LV network since these incur the largest costs due to the necessity to open
        up streets to place new cables.\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the chart you

      short_description:
      description: "The energy we use every day comes in the form of energy carriers
        like electricity, coal or natural gas. Some of these carriers are extracted
        from mines or wells. Such carriers are called primary carriers. They are often
        converted to more useful carriers like electricity, heat or gasoline, for
        example.   \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIn the ETM, the extraction of primary energy
        carriers is not (yet) the result of domestic or foreign demand. instead, domestic
        production is determined by annual production curves. \r\n <br/><br/>\r\nAlthough
        this is far from the ideal way of modeling the production of such carriers,
        it does spare the user rather complicated considerations like:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What
        are domestic resources and how (quickly) are they depleted in the intervening
        years between the present and future year modeled?</li>\r\n<li>What is maximum
        annual production capacity?</li>\r\n<li>How does annual production respond
        to different circumstances in the market?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSuch questions
        are not easily answered and would require quite a nit of extra input (sliders). "
