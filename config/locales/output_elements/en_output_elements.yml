      title: Effect of interconnector capacity on electricity price
      short_description: ''
      description: "The data in this chart is based on a relatively simple four country
        model (including NL, DE, BE and FR). The model optimises the production of
        electricity of the whole system taking interconnector capacities as boundary
        conditions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe main assumptions / simplifications used in
        the model are:\r\n<br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Merit Order can be represented as
        a polynomial of second degree. A smooth function is needed for the optimisation
        to reach a unique solution.</li>\r\n<li>Ramping speeds are not modeled: plants
        can switch on and off instantaneously.</li>\r\n<li>Loop flows are excluded
        (it is not possible for a country to receive its own exported electricity).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn
        this research, each country is represented as one single price\r\nzone comprising
        generation and load with interconnection to neighbouring countries. And only
        cross-border transmission capacities are taken into account. This means that
        constraints within each country are not considered. (see Chapter 4.3.2 of
        <a href=\"http://refman.et-model.com/publications/820\" target=\"_blank\">Wind
        Integration</a>)"

      title: Additional renewables vs. marginal electricity costs
      short_description: ''
      description: "This chart illustrates the effect that increased renewables have
        on wholesale electricity prices.<br><br>\r\nBecause the Merit Order prioritises
        the production by cheap producers, the increase of Renewable capacity translates
        in lower electricity prices for the country with the capacity. (see <a href=\"/scenario/costs/merit_order/merit-order\"
        >Merit Order</a>)\r\n<br><br>\r\nRenewable production is not dispatchable,
        so whenever there is a surplus of production it will be exported to other
        price-zones (countries in the model), respecting interconnection constraints.\r\nThis
        translates in lower prices also for the importer country because part of its
        demand is met by 'zero-cost' (and possibly negatively priced) supply. "

      description: "The ETM contains several flexibility technologies that are able
        to deal with excess electricity from wind turbines and solar panels. For each
        of these technologies, this table shows the installed capacity, which determines
        how much electricity you can store or convert at any time. The table also
        shows the storage volume, indicating the maximum volume available for storage
        or conversion. Finally, the last columns show the annual usage of the flexibility
        technologies in your scenario, both in PJ and TWh.\r\n</br></br>\r\nYou can
        set how much of each of these technologies you would like to install in your
        scenario in the Flexibility menu."
