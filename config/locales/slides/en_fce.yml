      title: Wood pellets
      short_description: ''
      description: Wood pellets can be co-fired in coal-fired power plants. Although
        no fossil CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted when wood is converted into electricity,
        greenhouse gases are emitted in earlier steps in the fuel chain, especially
        in the production and transport of wood. It is important to note that pellet
        production should not cause deforestation or other types of degradation of
        natural areas in order to have a positive impact on the climate at all. <a

    fce_coal:
      title: Coal
      short_description: ''
      description: "Coal is used worldwide as a fuel. It is readily available and
        therefore a secure and cheap source of energy for generations to come. However,
        it does produce more CO<sub>2</sub> than other fuels, and without proper management
        its production and utilization brings additional negative environmental and
        health impacts not associated with other fossil fuels. \r\n\r\n<a href=\"/texts/fce_coal\"

    fce_gas:
      title: Natural gas
      short_description: ''
      description: "Natural gas is a burning fossil fuel, of which global reserves
        are increasing. A relatively low carbon content and efficiency in power production
        result in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per kWhe that are half as large as for
        coal-based power production. Pre-treatment of raw natural gas comes on the
        opposite with negative impact on the local environment in some producing countries.
        Natural gas mostly consists of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas
        in itself. Natural gas can be exported through pipelines as a gas, or by ships
        when liquefied. Keep in mind that liquefaction changes the composition and
        therefore the attributes of natural gas, because some components are removed.

    fce_greengas:
      title: Green gas
      short_description: ''
      description: Green gas is treated biogas, which is produced from biomass. The
        biogas has been purified and enriched to have the same properties as natural
        gas, so it can be added to the gas grid. For the ETM, green gas production
        from co-digestion of maize silage and manure is assumed. Green gas has far
        lower chain emissions than fossil fuels, but is not completely climate neutral.
        Greenhouse gas emissions occur during maize cultivation and during biogas
        production and treatment. <a href="/texts/fce_greengas" class="fancybox">read

      title: FCE settings
      short_description:
      description: "<p>Greenhouse gasses are emitted when fuels are used, but also
        when they are extracted, treated and transported to their final destination.
        In this section,  you can choose to include these fuel chain emissions in
        the CO<sub>2</sub> calculations.</p>\r\n<p>For each type of fuel you can choose
        where it comes from. You will see that fuel chain emissions can vary strongly
        between regions of origin. Even direct CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from combustion
        vary between regions of origin, because coal from Eastern Europe is not the
        same as coal from North America, for example. Your mix of origins will change
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, regardless of whether 'FCE' is 'ON' or 'OFF'.</p>\r\n\r\n<div

      title: Mineral oil
      short_description:
      description: "Mineral oil is the source of many energy carriers, chemicals,
        plastics, fertilizer, etc. The numbers shown here are for crude oil itself.
        Emissions for refining or processing to obtain chemicals have not been included.
        <br/>\r\nThe oil market is more dynamic than that for natural gas, for example.
        The mix of origins is therefore not as clearly determined as for gas and can
        vary faster. For this reason, we have not included any sliders here. <a href=\"/texts/fce_oil\"

      title: Uranium
      short_description: ''
      description: 'Nuclear energy is a low-carbon technology: nuclear power plants
        do not emit CO<sub>2</sub>, but uranium mining, processing and transportation
        is associated with some CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This low-carbon technology
        comes at a price though: there is a small risk of severe nuclear accidents
        and no long-term solution has yet been found for the high-level radioactive
        waste. <a href="/texts/fce_uranium" class="fancybox">read more</a>'

      title: Liquid biofuels
      short_description:
      description: "The EU mandates a minimum percentage of liquid biofuels for road
        transport. Such fuels are often produced more efficiently in tropical countries.
        Is the entire fuel chain also more efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions?
        The biomass from which the liquid biofuels are produced can be chosen under
        <a href=\"/scenario/supply/biomass/supply_biomass_biofuels_production\">'Biomass'</a>
        and influences the fuel chain emissions. How much biofuel is used can be chosen
        under 'Transport fuels'\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/texts/fce_liquid_biofuels\" class=\"fancybox\">read
