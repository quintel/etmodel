  <h1 class="banner">Energy use and production</h1>

    <h2>Energy consumption</h2>

      The {{ future.biggest_final_demand_sector_name | without_unit }} sector is the largest consumer of energy
      with {{ future.biggest_final_demand_sector_value | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of <strong>final demand</strong>
      (the energy which is directly consumed by a sector).

      {% chart 146 %}
        Final energy demand for all sectors.
      {% endchart %}

      When it comes to <strong>primary demand</strong> (final demand plus all transformation and distribution losses),
      the energy use for the whole system looks like this:

      {% chart 52 %}
        Primary energy demand for all sectors.
      {% endchart %}

      When looking at primary demand, exported oil(products) can play a big role if refeneries are still producing
      at a significant rate.

    <h2>Electricity production</h2>

      <p>
        In your scenario, most electricity is produced by 
        {{ future.biggest_electricity_producer_name | without_unit }} 
        ({{ future.biggest_electricity_producer_value | autoscale: 'MJ'}}).
      </p>

      {% chart 99 %}
        Electricity mix.
      {% endchart %}

    <h2>Central heat network</h2>

      The central heat network in your scenario can be used to heat houses and buildings and provide heat
      to the industry and agricultural sectors. The chart below show the balance of heat produced and 
      consumed centrally.

      {% chart 174 %}
        Heat balance of central heat network.
      {% endchart %}

      {% if future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko > 0.0 %}
        <p>
          There is 
          {{ future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}} 
          excess heat produced in agriculture or industry which flows back into the central heat
          network but is not used by other sectors.<br>

          You can balance the network by
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reducing heat production</strong>: in the industry and agriculture sections you can 
              decrease numbers of CHPs and burners.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase demand</strong>: by increaing the demand of all sectors in the left-hand side
              of the diagram.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      {% else %}

          There is 
          {{ future.energy_heat_network_backup_heater_network_gas_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}}
          insufficient heat produced to satisfy the demand of the central heat network. A backup
          gas heater is deployed to satisfy the deficit.<br>

          You can balance the network by
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Building more heat production</strong>: in the industry and agriculture sections you can 
              generate more heat by increasing numbers of CHPs and burners.</li>
            <li><strong>Decreasing demand</strong>: by reducing the demand of all sectors in the left-hand side
              of the diagram.</li>

        </p>
      {% endif %}

  <h1 class="banner">CO2 Emissions</h1>

    <p>
      In your scenario, a CO2 emission reduction of {{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}%
      has been realised. The chart below relates the CO2 in {{ settings.end_year }} to the 1990 reference value and 
      emissions in {{ settings.start_year }}.
    </p>

    {% chart 46 %}
      CO2 emissions based on primary energy demand broken down by sector for 1990 (left), 
      {{ settings.start_year }} (middle), 
      and {{ settings.end_year }} (right). These figures represent emissions across the complete fuel chain
      including all transformations and losses.
    {% endchart %}

    <!-- Supports else, elsif, and unless. -->
    {% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 40.0 %}
      <p>
        The reduction of {{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}% exceeds the

        In your scenario, CO2 emission reductions fall short of the Dutch ambitions of 40% in 2030 
        and 80% - 95% in 2050. You can reduce CO2 by 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Realising energy savings</strong>: reduce energy consumption in the most energy-intensive sectors</li>
          <li><strong>Phasing out fossil fuels</strong>: heating and hot water in homes, transportation and electricity 
            production are places where fossil fuels can be replaced by CO2-neutral alternatives.</li>
          <li><strong>CCS(U)</strong>: Capturing, storing and, optionally, using CO2 can be viable options in the 
            energy-intensive industry and electricity generation (energy) sector.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: storage and conversion technologies enable you to utilise energy which would
          otherwise be exported or curtailed.</li>
          <li><strong>Fuel and CO2 pricing</strong>: by increasing the price of CO2 and fossil fuels, fossil plants might
          get less full load hours depending on the alternatives for electricity generation.</li>
        </ul>

<!--     <h2>CO2 emissions of biomass</h2>

    <p>
    Climate change is not induced by the annual CO2 emissions, but by the total amount of CO2 present
     in the air. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Usually no CO2 emissions are attributed to biomass as biomass absorbs as much CO2 as is emitted 
    during combustion (over the complete life cycle). The CO2 emitted by combustion of biomass is 
    not always absorbed within a time-scale that is relevant for climate change.
    </p>

      <h2>Merit order and fuel prices</h2>

        <p>
          The <i>merit order</i> ranks dispatchable power plants (those which you can switch on and off)
          according to their <i>marginal costs</i> (the costs of producing an extra MWh of electricity).
          Wind, solar and must-run plants have effectively zero marginal costs.
          The marginal costs and installed capacity of power generation for your scenario is shown in the 
          chart below.
        </p>

        {% chart 125 %}
          Merit order.
        {% endchart %}

        <p>
          Depending on the demand for electricity, the merit order determines which plants are running for each hour
          of the year. The plants with lowest marginal costs will often (baseload generation) whereas plants with 
          higher marginal costs might only run in cases of peak demand.          
        </p>

        <p>
          Fuel prices determine to a large extend the marginal costs of power plants. Increasing the proce of coal
          and/or CO2 can, for instance, make gas fueled power plants more compatitive with coal fired power plants.

  <h1 class="banner">Security of supply and profitability of power plants</h1>

    <h2>Reliability</h2>

    <p>
      The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is the expected number of hours per year that the electricity
       supply cannot meet its demand. A nonzero LOLE does not necessarily result in blackouts as 
       electricity can be imported or can be available in batteries. The Netherlands accepts a 
       LOLE of 4 h/yr. We distinguish (un)reliable electricity production as volatile electricity 
       producers cannot be relied on at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
      In your scenario, there is {{ future.dispatchable_electricity_production_capacity | autoscale: 'MW' }} of
      reliable (dispatchable) electricity production. Resulting in 
      {{ future.dashboard_security_of_supply | without_unit }} hours of loss of load.
    </p>

    {% chart 111 %}
      Reliability of production capacity.
    {% endchart %}

    <p>
      Similar to LOLE, the number of blackout hours is a measure for the reliability of the electricity 
      supply in your scenario. It also takes into account the possibility for import and flexibility to 
      prevent a shortage of power.
    </p>

    {% if future.dashboard_blackout_hours > 1 %}

        Your scenario has {{ future.dashboard_blackout_hours | without_unit }} blackout hours.

      <h2>Profitability of power plants</h2>

        <p>
          Security of (electricity) supply and the profitability of power plants are intimately linked. 
          For dispatchable power plants to make money, they need to run sufficiently often, ideally when
          electricity prices are high.
          A reliable electricity system traditionally requires, however, 
          that there are power plants available which are only needed for a couple of extreme demand peaks 
          every year.
        </p>

        <p>
          In your scenario, {{ future.profitability_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}% of powerplants is not 
          profitable. This means that they are not earning back their investment costs 
          (orange in table below) or are not even earning their OPEX (operational expenditure) back (red).
        </p>

        {% chart 140 %}
          Profitability of power plants.
        {% endchart %}

        <p>
          Unprofitable plants will likely be taken out of commission after a while. You can improve their profitability
          by incereasing electricity demand (making them run more hours). Also reducing electricity generation with zero
          marginal costs can make power plants profitable again.

          Like oil refineries, a large part of the production output of steel plants is currently 
          dedicated to cars. If, self-driving electric vehicles start to replace fossil fuel cars, 
          the number  of cars can be reduced dramatically. 

           are still {{ future.steel_industry_percentage | round: 1 }}% 
          of their current size. 

          Do you think this is realistic? For an analysis of the correllation between electrification
          of transport and the size of the refinery sector see the report
          "Industry in Transition" (Quintel Intelligence 2016).

    <h3>Space heating and hot water technologies</h3>
    <p>
      The space heating technologies in your scenario are not consistent with those producing hot
      water. You have chosen to heat most houses with a 
      {{ future.biggest_space_heater_share_name | without_unit }} whereas most of the hot water
      in households is produced by a 
      {{ future.biggest_water_heater_share_name | without_unit }}. The percentages
    </p>

    <p>
      NOTE: The combi-technology shares (percentages) in the households space heating and hot water 
      sections represent the market share of these technologies. This means that if you choose to 
      use technology A for space heating in 100% of the houses, and technology B for hot water in 
      100% of the households, every household containes one of both A and B.

  <!-- If curtailment occors, why not build more flex or industry use of H2? -->
  {% if future.electricity_curtailed > 0 %}

    <h2>Unused potential</h2>

    In your scenario, there are 
    {{ future.dashboard_total_number_of_excess_events }} hours that electricity production exceeds demand.
    This electricity is not used (curtailed). To usefully employ the excess electricity you can

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Store electricity</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build batteries in homes or 
        indicate how much of ellectric car batteries can be used for storing electricity.</li>
      <li><strong>Convert electricity to gas</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build power-to-gas plants
        to convert electricity to hydrogen gas.</li>
      <li><strong>Convert electricity to heat</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build power-to-heat plants
        which generate heat from electricity and store the heat for use in houses.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase interconnectivity</strong>: in the import/export section you can increase the capacity of
        the interconnectors with neighbouring countries.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase demand</strong>: by electrifying for example heating/hot water production in houses
      or transport.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Extreme assumptions</h2>

  Depending on your choices, this section point out some assumptions which imply big changes in the whole energy system.
  This might help you to focus on which aspects of your scenario could use some extra argumentation or research.


  <!-- Extreme amount of greengas -->
  {% if future.share_of_greengas_in_gas_network > 0.05 %}

    <h3>Greengas and areable land</h3>

    <p>
      Your scenario has {{ future.share_of_greengas_in_gas_network | times: 100 | round: 1 }}% of greengas mixed into the gas
      network. This requires about {{ future.bio_footprint_of_greengas_km | round: 1 }} of areable
      land which is {{ future.bio_footprint_of_greengas_fraction_of_areable_land | round: 1 }} times the available
      areable land in your country.
    </p>

  {% endif %}

  <!-- Unprofitable plants -->
  {% if settings.merit_order_enabled %}
    {% if future.profitability_percentage > 10 %}
      <p>
        In your scenario, {{ future.profitability_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}% of powerplants is not 
        profitable. This means that they are not earning back their investment costs and sometimes not even their running costs.
        Such plants will not stay open very long. Having them around in your future year might not be realistic.
        You can either
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Increase electricity demand</strong>: making the unprofitable plants run more hours could improve their
            situation.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce competing production</strong>: typically, wind and solar electricity generation has marginal costs
            close to zero, 'pushing' conventional plants out of the merit order.</li>
          <li><strong>Close the plants</strong>: closing unprofitable plants might increase the realism of your scenario as such
            plants are not expected to exist very long.</li>
        </ul>

    This table shows an overview of the investment cost of heat and electricity producing 
    technologies. The investment costs are shown for both the start scenario (2010) and for the 
    future scenario. In both cases a 'green-field' approach is taken: no previously installed 
    technologies are assumed. The last column shows the difference between the investment costs 
    of the two scenarios.

  <h1 class="banner">APPENDIX C: About The Energy Transition Model</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
      <p>
        The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com">Energy Transition Model (ETM)</a> is 
        a free, open-source, web-based
         energy model for the exploration of energy scenario's.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ETM is for anyone who wants to explore and create energy scenarios for countries, cities, 
        neighbourhoods and even streets.
        No prior knowledge is assumed and the ETM is therefore of interest to both experts and students. 
        You can make assumptions about demand and supply of different types of energy from the source to 
        the application. the ETM determines, for all stakeholders in the system, sustainability, reliability 
        and affordability at national and local level.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can look up how the ETM compares to other models on 
        <a href="www.energierekenmodellen.nl">energierekenmodellen.nl</a>.
      </p>


    <h2>Beyond The Energy Transition Model</h2>

      <p>
        <i>"All models are wrong but some are useful"</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>George Box</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Quintel strives to properly include all important features of the energy system, the ETM nescessarily 
        has a limited scope and should not be used as a substitute for critical thought. On the contrary! Hopefully, the
        user is inspired to challenge results and limits of the model and starts thinking outside of the boudaries of
        the Energy Transition Model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following (very) incomplete list of topics is indicative of the limits of the ETM:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Human behaviour</strong>: arguably the biggest impact on the success of failure of energy transition 
            is declared out of scope of the primarily technical ETM.</li>
          <li><strong>Economic relations</strong>: the ETM calculates costs based on published values but does not assume
            price-elasticity relations or other economic relations which may no longer apply in the future.</li>
          <li><strong>Policy</strong>: no subsedies or taxes are assumed in the ETM, they are viewed as the possible
            motivation for the choices of the user, however.</li>
        </ul>
