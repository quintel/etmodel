# Unit conversions are added by using the `key` for the input element. Then,
# create a hash where each key is an I18n string (under unit_conversions.*)
# and the value a two-element array consisting of the unit suffix, and the
# multiplier.
#
# For example, assuming a slider whose default value is in gigawatts:
#
#   my_input_element:
#     megawatts: [ MW, 1000 ]
#
# This would add a "megawatts" conversion to the "my_input_element" element.
# The label for the conversion would be looked up using I18n as
# "unit_conversions.megawatts".
#
# When displaying the value of the slider in megawatts, the sliders internal
# value will be multiplied by 1000, and given the suffix "MW".
#
#   My Input Element   (-) <-----()------------------> (+)   2.5 GW
#
#     ... becomes ...
#
#   My Input Element   (-) <-----()------------------> (+)  2500 MW

# YAML references may be used to reduce duplication.
#
#   common_coal_conversions: &common_coal_conversions
#     kilowatts: [ KW, 1000000 ]
#     megawatts: [ MW, 1000    ]
#
#   coal_ccs:
#     <<: *common_coal_conversions
#   coal_iggc:
#     <<: *common_coal_conversions
#
# In the above example, the `coal_ccs` and `coal_iggc` elements would inherit
# their conversions from `common_coal_conversions`.
